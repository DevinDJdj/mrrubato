@@what does news dot py do
==
News.py is a Python package that provides a simple way to read and write text data in a news format. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

Initialization

* The package is initialized with a URL to a news website (e.g. CNN).
* It imports the `newspaper` module, which is a wrapper around the `pynewspaper` library.

Reading and Writing Text Data

* The `newspaper` module provides a `build()` function to create a `newspaper` object from a URL.
* The `newspaper` object can be used to read and write text data in a news format.
* The `build()` function returns a `newspaper` object that can be used to read and write text data in a news format.

Example Usage

* The package provides several examples of how to use the `newspaper` module:
+ Reading the URL and printing the text data: `cnn_article = cnn_paper.articles[0]cnn_article.download()cnn_article.parse()cnn_article.nlp()print(cnn_article.keywords)`
+ Writing text data: `cnn_article = cnn_paper.articles[0]cnn_article.download()cnn_article.parse()cnn_article.nlp()`
+ Printing the URL and text data: `cnn_article = cnn_paper.articles[0]print(cnn_article.keywords)print(cnn_article.summary)print(cnn_article.text)print(cnn_article.authors)print(cnn_article.publish_date)`

Features

* The package provides several features that make it easy to work with news data:
+ Aggregation: The package allows you to aggregate text data from multiple articles.
+ Feedback loop: The package provides a feedback loop that allows users to provide feedback on the news data.
+ TTS (Text-to-Speech) capabilities: The package allows you to generate TTS for news articles.

Conclusion

* News.py is a simple and easy-to-use package for working with news data in a Python environment.
* It provides several features that make it easy to work with news data, including aggregation, feedback loops, and TTS capabilities.

Here's an example of how you might use the `newspaper` module:
```python
import newspaper

cnn_paper = newspaper.build('cnn.com')
cnn_article = cnn_paper.articles[0]

# Read the article
cnn_article.download()
cnn_article.parse()

# Print the keywords	

@@what does filbert dot HTML do	
==
The `filbert` HTML snippet appears to be a simple, interactive code editor with some basic features. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. Selecting a parser: The user can select one of two parsers: `filbert.js` or `filbert_loose.js`. The `filbert` parser is a simple, text-based parser that can parse and execute Python code.
2. Parsing code: When the user types Python code into the editor, the code is parsed by the `filbert` parser. The parsed code is then displayed in the `astText` textarea.
3. Executing code: The user can click a button to execute the parsed code. The `compile()` function is called, which attempts to execute the code. If the code is valid, it is executed; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
4. Updating display: The `compile()` function updates the display by displaying the result of the code execution. If the code is invalid, the display is updated with an error message.

Here are some key features of the `filbert` editor:

* Simple syntax: The editor supports a simple syntax for Python code, which is limited to basic arithmetic, string concatenation, and assignment operations.
* Interactive: The editor is interactive, meaning that the user can modify the code and see the effects immediately.
* Error reporting: The editor reports errors in the code, which can help the user identify and fix issues.

Overall, the `filbert` HTML snippet is a basic, interactive code editor that can parse and execute simple Python code.
