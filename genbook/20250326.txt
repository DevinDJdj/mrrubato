I'm happy to help you understand what's happening. It seems like you're working on a project that involves building a video recording and sharing platform. You've designed a system that allows users to record videos, upload them to the cloud, and then share them with others.

Here are some key points that might help clarify what's going on:

1. **Service calls are being made to IndexedDB**: You've switched to using IndexedDB instead of Firebase Realtime Database (RTDB). This is a good choice, as IndexedDB is a more modern and flexible database that can handle complex use cases.
2. **FTS (Full-text Search) is being used**: You've decided to use FTS to index your video content. This is a good choice, as FTS can provide fast and efficient search capabilities for your content.
3. **SaveLocal button is being used**: You've added a SaveLocal button to your platform, which allows users to save their recorded videos locally. This is a good choice, as it provides a convenient way for users to save their recordings.
4. **Highlight boxes are being created**: You've implemented a feature that allows users to create highlight boxes on their recorded videos. These highlight boxes can be used to mark important parts of the video, such as transitions or keyframes.

To summarize, you've made the following changes to your platform:

* Switched from Firebase RTDB to IndexedDB
* Used FTS to index your video content
* Added a SaveLocal button
* Implemented a feature to create highlight boxes

These changes should make your platform more robust and user-friendly. However, it's worth noting that you still need to address some of the challenges that you mentioned, such as ensuring public uploads are pushed to YouTube and implementing a way to save on stop recording.

I'm not sure what you're referring to. The text appears to be a long, detailed description of a language, including its grammar, syntax, and sound patterns. It also mentions the author's experience with a language learning program and their observations about the language's mechanics. If you could provide more context or clarify what you're looking for, I'd be happy to try and assist you.
