**What is this code?**

This is a JavaScript code snippet that appears to be a part of a larger application, likely a visualization or data visualization tool. The code is written in a style that suggests it's using the Vis.js library, which is a popular JavaScript library for creating interactive and web-based visualizations.

**What does this code do?**

This code snippet seems to be a part of a larger application that allows users to interact with visualizations (e.g., graphs, charts, etc.). Here's a high-level overview of what each section of code does:

1. **Importing DOT language**: The code imports a DOT language string, which is a format for describing complex graphs and networks.
2. **Creating a network**: The code creates a new network using the imported DOT language string. This network is likely used to visualize and interact with the graph.
3. **Setting up options**: The code sets up options for the network, including animation and selection capabilities.
4. **Highlighting nodes**: The code focuses on specific nodes in the graph, allowing users to interact with them.
5. **Getting graph data**: The code retrieves the current graph data, including nodes and edges.
6. **Clearing nodes and edges**: The code clears all nodes and edges from the graph, which can be useful for resetting the visualization.
7. **Fitting the graph**: The code fits the graph to a certain size or scale, which can be useful for adjusting the visualization.

**What's the purpose of this code?**

The purpose of this code is likely to create a dynamic and interactive visualization of a graph or network. The code allows users to interact with the visualization, which can be useful for understanding and exploring the data.

**What's the context of this code?**

The code is likely part of a larger application that allows users to interact with visualizations. The context of this code is likely a web-based application, such as a website or web application, that allows users to create and share visualizations.
