 okay that's good so I can read the previous iteration (0:00)
 date, eventually they will have multiple previous iterations (0:11)
 I don't know if they will ever read the same one (0:15)
 probably not, anyway (0:19)
 I'm not enthralled by the ease of use of these local GPT libraries (0:22)
 I'm not sure why they use the word embeddings (0:47)
 it's not intuitive at all (0:58)
 it doesn't fit, but it doesn't (1:01)
 I mean it's essentially the vocabulary (1:15)
 the vocabulary of the language that you're speaking (1:18)
 embeddings is such a bad term (1:24)

 So it's really hard to change a word once you get started (7:33)
 I was thinking about embeddings (7:47)
 It's part of the vernacular now (7:53)
 which I don't like (7:59)
 I mean how do you go about changing a word? (8:05)
 It's not an interesting concept (8:11)

 So I was thinking about why do I not like embeddings (13:43)
 Because generally I don't really care that much (13:49)
 In other words, but I do think this technology is going to become (13:53)
 such an integral part of learning (14:01)
 And of understanding of the world (14:07)
 I think it's important that we use words that give it the gravity that it deserves (14:15)
 I mean embeddings is like a completely technical term just for technical people (14:23)
 But this is not something that only technical people should be understanding (14:29)
