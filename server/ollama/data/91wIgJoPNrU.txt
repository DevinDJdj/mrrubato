 I mean I hate it when I have RF noise problems. I don't know if I'm still have my... (0:00)
 trying to move some cables around but there was also a weird thing. I think it (0:08)
 was because of lag in the machine that the audio quality decreased. I mean I'm (0:16)
 not running this on any high-spec machine. It's just like a standard laptop. (0:28)
 Interesting. I think it was too much open probably because the analyze... (0:34)
 yeah the analyze, it's still listening to the video as well. Probably that creates some sort of lag. (0:57)
 I'm not sure. That should be real time I think. I mean priority should be given to the audio. (1:06)
 I think they have that running like a higher priority thread. (1:25)
 I like the title. (1:29)
 Now is the time to seize the day. (3:25)
 Now is the time to seize the day. (3:56)
 Send out a call and seize away. (4:01)
 Send out, send out a call. (4:08)
 Send out a call and join the fray. (4:12)
 Until, until the right, right end. (4:18)
 If, if where you're right end, (4:31)
 it sees the day, the day. (4:42)
 Friends of the throne, endless seize the day. (4:58)
 Friends of the friendless seize the day. (5:04)
 Raise up the torch and light away. (5:08)
 Raise up the torch and light away. (5:15)
 Raise up the torch and light away. (5:38)
 Raise up the torch and light away. (5:42)
 Raise up the torch and light away. (5:50)
 Raise up the torch and light away. (5:54)
 Too slow. (6:00)
 Open the gate and seize the day. (6:30)
 Don't be afraid and seize away. (6:58)
 Don't be afraid to seize away. (7:03)
 Nothing can break us. (7:09)
 No one can break us ever. (7:14)
 We go to, we go. (7:28)
 We go, we go. (7:55)
 For the day. (8:02)
 Too slow. (8:08)
 That's not quite as lyrical as the stuff I've played from him before. (8:35)
 I really need to change this mechanism for my start and stop timing. (8:47)
 But I have been thinking about the machine learning aspect of technology. (9:00)
 I do believe the feedback mechanism needs to be analyzed and the attribution mechanism, (9:22)
 where the data was sourced from, is not, is problematic, I believe. (9:36)
 I mean, I've been thinking about how, like, OpenAI or something made the software that they did, (9:46)
 and having no attribution. (9:57)
 I mean, at least if you do like a search on Google, it attributes the content to the creator of the content. (10:03)
 I mean, the creator of the content is the owner of the website. (10:13)
 I mean, the original creator of the content, it should be sourced in some way, right? (10:16)
 And I think we have a problem. (10:23)
 We have a source management problem. (10:28)
 I don't mean like source code management. (10:33)
 I mean, the origin of data. (10:36)
 We have an origin of data problem. (10:41)
 And a long time ago, it was too hard to reproduce content or to refactor, I guess I'll say, content. (10:44)
 But now it's become so easy. (10:57)
 It's so easy, I mean, to ingest and refactor content in a variety of ways. (11:03)
 And so we really need to try and do a better job of sourcing content. (11:13)
 It's going to be so problematic. (11:28)
 We can't do that better soon. (11:31)
 Because that is part of the reason for the confusion that we have in the world. (11:36)
 It is you don't have good content sourcing mechanisms. (11:48)
 It's not built into the content ingestion. (11:53)
 Unfortunately, content creation has become so simple. (12:02)
 Anyway. (12:15)
 Open the gate and cease the day. (12:23)
 Don't be afraid to cease the day. (12:35)
 You're full of fear and fear. (12:45)
 See what's real. (12:51)
 Is the time to see the day. (13:45)
 Send out a call and seize the day. (13:57)
 Now is the time to join the fray. (14:03)
 Things will be written. (14:09)
 Heisman will show them. (14:14)
 Let us all seize the day. (14:19)
 Right away. (14:39)
 Life's a than dear. (14:47)

 I'm gonna be a man, I'm gonna be a man (17:50)
 It's definitely different than the other pieces that I play (18:10)
 I'm gonna be a man, I'm gonna be a man (18:41)
 I'm gonna be a man, I'm gonna be a man (18:51)
 I'm gonna be a man, I'm gonna be a man (19:01)
 Rise and she's living (19:31)
 Now is the time to seize the day (20:01)
 Now is the time to seize the day (20:09)
 Send out the children, come and play (20:15)
 Rise and be righted (20:23)

 Oh, oh, oh, oh (22:13)
 When the day turns to the day (22:37)
 Don't be afraid to move your way (22:41)
 Open the gates and seize the day (22:47)
 Don't be afraid to move your way (23:11)
 Oh, oh, oh, oh (23:16)
 The Seized the Day (23:22)
 Friends of the Friendless are in play (23:28)
 Do it! (23:34)
