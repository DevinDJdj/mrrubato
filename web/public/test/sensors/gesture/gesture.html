        <!-- <h2>How to Use</h2> -->
        <p>Welcome to the Gesture Music Generator! Get ready to create music with just the movement of your hands.
            Here’s how to get started:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Set Up:</strong> Position yourself in front of the webcam. Make sure your hands are visible in
                the camera frame.</li>
            <li><strong>Start the Application:</strong> Once the video feed is live, the system will start tracking your
                hand movements.</li>
            <li><strong>Creating Sounds:</strong> Move your hands to different areas of the camera frame. The position
                and movement of your hands will change the musical notes and sounds produced.</li>
            <li><strong>Experiment with Gestures:</strong> Try different hand shapes and movements. Open or close your
                fingers, wave, or even clap to explore various sound effects.</li>
            <li><strong>Recording:</strong> If you want to record your music, simply start the recording feature. Once
                done, you can save your creation to revisit it later.</li>
            <li><strong>Have Fun:</strong> There’s no right or wrong way to use this. Feel free to experiment and enjoy
                the unique music you create!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: The Gesture Music Generator is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. However, if you encounter any
            issues or have questions, please refer to our FAQ section or contact support.</p>


        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>The Gesture Music Generator is a fusion of advanced computer vision and audio synthesis technologies. Using
            MediaPipe, we track hand and body movements in real-time through your webcam. These movements are then
            translated into musical notes and sounds using Tone.js, a powerful Web Audio framework. The position, speed,
            and gesture of your hands dynamically alter the music, creating a unique and interactive audio experience.
        </p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>Our Gesture Music Generator comes packed with exciting features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Hand Tracking:</strong> Instantaneous and accurate hand movement detection.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Sound Synthesis:</strong> Varied musical notes and effects based on your gestures.</li>
            <li><strong>Interactive Visual Feedback:</strong> Visual representation of your movements and the
                corresponding musical notes on the screen.</li>
            <li><strong>Recording Capability:</strong> Easily record and save your musical creations.</li>
            <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> Simple and intuitive, suitable for users of all ages and skill
                levels.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>To ensure the best experience with the Gesture Music Generator, please make sure you have the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A modern web browser (Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, etc.) with JavaScript enabled.</li>
            <li>A stable internet connection for downloading necessary libraries and resources.</li>
            <li>A webcam with good resolution and frame rate for accurate gesture tracking.</li>
            <li>Adequate lighting to ensure your movements are captured clearly by the webcam.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Compatibility</h2>
        <p>The Gesture Music Generator is designed to work across a wide range of devices and browsers. However, for the
            best experience, we recommend using the latest version of Chrome or Mozilla Firefox on a desktop or
            laptop with a dedicated graphics card. Mobile devices may experience reduced performance due to the
            intensive nature of real-time video processing.</p>

        <h2>Acknowledgment</h2>
        <p>I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the support and assistance provided during the development
            of the Gesture Music Generator. A special mention goes to ChatGPT-4 and GitHub Copilot, whose AI-driven
            insights and coding assistance were invaluable in overcoming technical challenges and enhancing the tool's
            capabilities.</p>
        <p>My appreciation also extends to "SynthTrails" by Michael Holborn, accessible at <a
                href="https://synthy.michaelholborn.com/" target="_blank">https://synthy.michaelholborn.com/</a>. This
            innovative platform provided inspiration and insights into the potential of integrating music synthesis with
            user interaction in a web environment. The creativity and technical execution of "SynthTrails" were
            influential in the conceptualization and development of this project.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I am thankful to the wider developer and open-source communities. Their shared knowledge,
            resources, and libraries played a crucial role in the realization of this project. The contributions and
            discussions from various forums and platforms provided guidance and inspiration throughout the development
            process.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I am thankful to every user who has interacted with the Gesture Music Generator. Your feedback,
            whether as beta testers or early adopters, has been instrumental in refining its features and usability.
            This project is not just a product of technology, but also of collective effort and shared passion for
            innovation in music and technology.</p>
