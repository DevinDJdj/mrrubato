        "transcript": " Yeah, okay. (0:00)\n It's been a while. (0:30)\n I feel like I've been... (0:35)\n I mean, there's a lot of repetition to playing the piano, but... (0:41)\n You want to make progress, but it feels like kind of, you know... (0:48)\n Just repeating the same thing over and over. (0:58)\n I mean, music is like that to a certain extent. (1:00)\n There's so many ideas unrelated with music. (1:12)\n I don't know why I wanted to play this, but I turned the volume up on the piano. (1:22)\n I played this once or twice. (1:30)\n It sounds a little bit different with the volume up. (1:37)\n It makes me play a little bit differently, I think. (1:42)\n I did want to play this in the piano. (2:00)\n Just want to have a new recommendation for a new song. (2:03)\n This is from a pleasure. (2:09)\n Some of the opportunities that have been offered to us in theape様 (2:12)\n I don't know if you've made them for you. (2:18)\n An additional opportunity to get to know our (2:22)\n knots of the song. (2:28)\n They certainly are incredible artists, (15:00)\n but thank you so much for being here today. (15:02)\n They definitely are incredible artists. (15:05)\n So, I'm trying to not, I was just asking beingourt, (15:09)\n so I'm trying to not look at the keys in, (15:12)\n not look at the music a little bit, (15:14)\n but I have to look at the music. (15:17)\n I think I really do have to memorize this stuff, (15:20)\n part of the issue type. (15:22)\n And it's just as much opposite thoughts (15:23)\n you just put up on me. (15:25)\n I'm sorry. (15:27)\n I didn't do it right. (15:28)\n Okay. (15:28)\n Oh, yeah. (15:28)\n Oh. (15:28)\n It's just not going to work the same unless I... I mean... (15:28)\n Yeah, I think that it's just going to be a necessity. (15:35)\n I mean... (15:43)\n I don't know if my mind is going to allow me to do that. (15:46)\n When John cut his hair short he never인 an Uber driver's seat Drake's phone, and it was in the drive-in không (16:16)\n The car was hard to drive. (16:44)\n When she was down carserviced. (16:46)\n Yeah. (16:46)\n What's it got to do with that? (16:46)\n Well, I heard one thing. (16:46)\n It's been so long. (29:40)\n I don't know when eventually I'm going to get around to it. (29:46)\n I mean, I should probably be talking about something other than music as well. (29:53)\n I'm not sure what I want to do. (30:00)\n I mean, music is part of what I'm trying to do. (30:06)\n It's more the process of learning which I'm trying to understand. (30:15)\n I think... (30:27)\n I mean, who knows how far I'm actually going to get with this. (30:36)\n Because I'm a little bit lazy as well. (30:47)\n I'm not sure if I'll actually be able to create something interesting. (30:54)\n But, I mean... (31:02)\n That being said, (31:05)\n You don't just stop. (31:06)\n Because you're not sure how much you're going to be able to accomplish in life. (31:17)\n Right? (31:25)\n F teenagers. (31:40)\n These have become actually like grown-ups' BB to hotлей or to going into comedy. (31:41)\n I had to interrupt whatever happened to her, because I was thinking, you know you may realize (31:49)\n I don't think I'm memorizing enough. (42:32)\n I mean, the balance between memorizing and not. (42:34)\n I mean, there are some songs, like some arrangements or whatever, where you don't really care that much. (42:51)\n I mean, old classical pieces. (43:01)\n I mean, there are some songs like this that the people spent a significant amount of their time teasing out exactly what they wanted. (43:04)\n Sometime. (43:34)\n Hmm. (43:37)\n Thanks. (57:33)\n",

(0:37)\n I mean the piano as well. I like playing the piano even though I'm not good. (0:45)\n I think it does help to play without the pedal sometimes. (0:54)\n I mean it makes me generate a lot of it's still very sloppy but it makes me fiddle with the keys I guess I would say. (1:06)\n I mean I'm not sure how most people envision music or musicality but I've said before creation is at the core. (1:24)\n One of the core principles of music and what makes music interesting. (1:44)\n I wish I was better. (2:03)\n You never had to try before. (2:45)\n Mmm, zone in my gun. (2:59)\n And I don't see you anymore. (3:14)\n I would not leave you in times of trouble.

(4:54)\n You always had a little compassion. (5:08)\n Although I might not seem to care. (5:21)\n I don't want to have a conversation. (5:34)\n You never could have come. (5:55)\n I don't want to try anything. (6:03)\n I just want something that I can talk to. (6:09)\n And I want you just the way you are. (6:27)\n I need to know that you will love with me. (6:39)\n I'll say more than what I know. (7:09)\n I said I love you. (7:59)\n And then we went to a river. (8:15)\n And the first person I met. (8:25)\n I could have loved you. (8:34)\n Oh, honey, babe. (8:47)\n I love you just the way you are. (8:57)\n I don't want clever conversations. (11:03)\n I never want to talk that long. (11:28)\n Imagine. (13:09)\n I want to forget. (13:34)\n And I don't see you anymore. (13:46)\n I want to leave you. (13:55)\n In times of trouble. (14:03)\n We never want to talk this long. (14:09)\n I took the trouble. (14:18)\n I'll take you just the way you are. (14:34)\n Don't go trying. (14:48)\n Some infatuation. (14:55)\n Don't change the cause of the pain. (15:02)\n I always had a lot of stalky passion. (15:10)\n I thought that I might not seem to care. (15:25)\n The whole trouble. (15:40)\n This conversation. (15:46)\n I never thought I'd do what I've been doing. (15:51)\n I want you just the way you are. (16:18)\n I need to know that you're still there, my friend.

(17:53)\n Man, there's such a juxtaposition between playing with the pedal and without the pedal. (21:55)\n I mean, the minute interactions between pushing the pedal many times I've not really done anything with. (22:03)\n So I basically play with the pedal or without the pedal for the most part. (22:20)\n I mean, for phrasing, for chord phrasing, I'll lift the pedal, but any minute interactions go unnoticed. (22:25)\n The only thing I really do is chord phrasing with the pedal. (22:38)\n I don't know the terminology. (22:44)\n You never had to try to forget. (22:48)\n Don't imagine. (23:18)\n You're not too familiar. (23:28)\n And I don't see you anymore. (23:34)\n I would not leave you in times of trouble. (23:43)\n I would never could have come in front. (24:03)\n I'd take a better, better, I'd take you just a little. (24:21)\n Don't, don't go there again. (24:44)\n Come around, so here's a show. (24:54)\n Don't change the color of your skin. (25:02)\n You always had unspoken passion. (25:13)\n And though I don't seem to care. (25:26)\n I don't want clever conversation. (25:42)\n I don't want a little more. (25:52)\n I don't want to drive it home. (26:00)\n I just want someone that I can talk to. (26:10)\n I want you just so we can. (26:23)\n I need to know that you will go with me. (26:39)\n But is there any hope? (26:56)\n Eat your ruler. (27:00)\n And this I promise forever I could love (27:56)\n and love forever (28:25)\n accomplish (28:48)\n ... (29:17)\n I don't walk a level conversation (30:17)\n I never want to try anymore (30:35)\n I don't walk a level conversation (31:05)\n I never want to try anymore (31:15)\n You can maybe show up (31:26)\n Turn me off (31:30)\n Girl, I wanna find you (31:35)\n Girl (31:53)\n So I was thinking about real-time generating images and interacting with them. (31:55)\n I mean the image generation stuff requires a particular CPU, which is annoying. (32:13)\n I do so much computer stuff already. (32:23)\n I'm always torn between doing something on the computer and playing the piano when I have some free time. (32:38)\n I mean the computer is what allows me to provide food. (32:56)\n It is the tool of our time. (33:08)\n You think about all of the inventions and the tools. (33:14)\n It is exponential. I mean the change is exponential. (33:23)\n What computers have done for our generation with regards to convenience and stuff like that. (33:29)\n It's allowed exponential progress in a fundamental sense. (33:39)\n But it's also allowed any individual to have much more effect on the environment around them. (33:50)\n I mean there are a lot of top CEOs who have a strong drive for money. (34:06)\n I don't think all of them do. Some of them are just intrigued by the world. (34:26)\n People latch onto them really. (34:36)\n Because people are seeking understanding. (34:42)\n Understanding as well as progress. (34:51)\n I see some of the tidbits in news. (35:00)\n I don't think I'm jealous of people who have a huge sphere of influence necessarily. (35:06)\n It's definitely a different existence. (35:16)\n To try and play the game you never made me down before. (35:36)\n I don't even know what to feel. (36:01)\n I don't even know what to give. (36:18)\n I would not leave you. (36:37)\n In times of trouble, I know all of them are. (36:43)\n I'll take a breath at once. (37:07)\n I'll take you just who you are. (37:16)\n Don't go crying. Some new ration. This world ain't fit for someone. (37:35)\n Oh, you are willing to find your passion. (37:58)\n Although you might not seem to care. (38:12)\n I don't want to just go with you. (39:19)\n I need you to know that you love me. (39:49)\n Some new song. (40:17)\n I said I love you. (41:20)\n And that's all it. (41:25)\n A conversation. (43:57)\n I don't want to let go. (44:07)\n I just want someone. (44:18)\n That I can talk to. (44:25)\n I don't want to just go with you. (44:31)\n",

(0:18)\n I mean, he's trying to teach you something, I think, with each, (0:20)\n with each one. (0:29)\n So, I mean, and he has a style.

(8:36)\n I mean, music is an interesting topic. (8:44)\n And I don't, I mean, it's just a series and patterns of sound (8:49)\n that you enjoy or don't enjoy. (8:57)\n I don't think we have a very good understanding (9:00)\n of the underlying reasons that we like it or don't like it. (9:04)\n I mean, there are certain mathematical patterns (9:14)\n like dissonance that we understand. (9:18)\n But the patterns that are preferred within those notes (9:22)\n and within the patterns, I don't think we have a very good (9:30)\n understanding of it. (9:38)\n Like, in general, what is preferred as to what is not preferred. (9:40)\n So I am trying to understand that. (9:46)\n But I mean, I am going back to why I don't want to be taught (9:53)\n because I think it's a fundamental part of yourself (9:59)\n that wants to utilize the knowledge that they have (10:05)\n to further something. (10:13)\n So it's the same. (10:15)\n It's looking internally as opposed to externally. (10:17)\n And I think music can be that. (10:20)\n It's something to look internally at yourself. (10:23)\n I don't think we have a very good understanding (10:43)\n of the underlying reasons that we like it or don't like it.

(9:40)\n When you're determining the success of the (9:44)\n communication platform, I mean speed is one of the (9:48)\n core factors. (9:52)\n But there's also the (10:00)\n integrity of the information right? (10:04)\n So that's kind of what I (10:08)\n Think about (10:12)\n when I'm thinking about measuring the (10:16)\n information within the (10:20)\n within the video. I mean I was thinking about a lot of (10:24)\n things just now. But would any of (10:28)\n that come across in, I mean one (10:32)\n thing is voice patterns, another thing is facial (10:36)\n markers and (10:40)\n understandings from those markers. (10:44)\n So (10:48)\n there's a lot to be inferred. (10:52)\n So I keep looking over at this (15:16)\n at the fast one (15:20)\n that I hate. (15:24)\n But I want to try it again. (15:28)\n I don't know why. (15:32)\n",

(0:09)\n I think I was just hanging off the bed or something but it really hurts. (0:14)\n I mean I'd thought about playing just with one hand just to practice or whatever before but (0:18)\n I really don't like that. (0:23)\n It really hurts so I'm just gonna play it with my right hand. (0:28)\n I've been thinking a lot about how to phrase the words in music (0:42)\n I think that's kind of how you separate them in your mind and then in your fingers (0:51)\n is it becomes the way that the music sounds. (1:00)\n And of course there's rhythmic indications (1:07)\n which I don't really follow that strictly but I mean that along with your fingers and your mind (1:16)\n it becomes the sound of the people. (1:27)\n So I was thinking about how I should phrase it programmatically. (1:32)\n Because I mean I've got enough data on some pieces now where I can try to (1:45)\n I can try to essentially generate an averaged out or see progressions of changes. (1:55)\n I mean really what I'm doing is just see the progressions of the change (2:04)\n and generate a feedback mechanism to be able to improve. (2:11)\n I mean music is something that I mean you don't always want to improve speed (2:23)\n but having the ability to go faster is certainly a tool that not a lot of people are able to do. (2:31)\n I mean because that is one of the hardest things. (2:45)\n Figuring out how exactly you can play faster. (2:51)\n",

        "transcript": " So I'm already headed down this road a little bit playing with just one hand. (0:00)\n I don't know that it changes anything that much. (0:06)\n I mean, it definitely made me concentrate on this. (0:15)\n I mean, I played this many times now. (0:19)\n I played it so many times that I broke my analyze program. (0:24)\n Because I had just put in like 20 iterations. (0:33)\n I only put room for 20 iterations for some logic I was doing in that program. (0:38)\n But I mean, there's nothing that interesting yet. (0:47)\n But I was just thinking about what it changed playing with just one hand. (0:56)\n I mean, I think it made me remember, made me basically memorize this piece, I think. (1:04)\n I mean, it's not completely memorized, but it's pretty close now. (1:12)\n And what else? (1:23)\n It made me play more what's on the page. (1:29)\n I don't know if that's good or bad. (1:35)\n I mean, I don't really want to do this sort of thing. (1:42)\n But I'm trying to understand where this leads. (1:46)\n Like when you're learning something, you have to try different paths before you understand what actually works. (1:54)\n I mean, you have to actually look at the results. (2:06)\n I mean, for something like this, this is like sports, essentially. (2:10)\n I mean, playing a musical instrument, it's concentrating your body into an act that is a combination of body and mind act. (2:15)\n It's a curious thing. (2:31)\n But yeah, all I'm saying is this requires a lot of repetition to actually get the precision, I think, that you want at any decent speed. (2:44)\n And speed is important, I think, for the simple fact that you can do more repetitions if you can play quickly. (3:08)\n I'm going to be a little bit of a (14:52)\n slide (15:26)\n as (15:37)\n I mean the top part of this the right hand of this is definitely more difficult (16:11)\n but I mean that's generally the case for him. I believe he was right-handed. (16:24)\n Sometimes it seems really long. I mean even just that, (25:35)\n there's a lot to play with. (26:04)\n",

        "transcript": " Man, this is really annoying. I leave notes for myself. (0:00)\n Nice little poetic information. (0:05)\n But I forgot to push the buttons in the right process. (0:12)\n What else am I thinking about? Yeah, the words that I'm gonna use to store the... (0:20)\n ...the data. (0:24)\n The structure of data is very significant. (0:29)\n I was thinking to myself regarding the structure of data often controls how you... (0:33)\n ...how you find insights into that data. (0:43)\n And so people don't necessarily give us thought to the structure of the data that you decide to work with. (0:45)\n I mean, because a lot of the time you're not creating the structure. (0:55)\n I mean, most people are just working with the structure. (1:00)\n They're not looking at the system and saying, this is how it should work, not this way. (1:05)\n And I say that for most situations. (1:15)\n I mean, you're just a piece of the puzzle. (1:21)\n You're not the creator of the puzzle. (1:26)\n But I mean, sometimes you get to pull around and become the creator of a small part of the world. (1:29)\n But this...I was thinking about the data and I was also thinking about how I'm gonna use those words to analyze. (1:40)\n So yeah, the structure of the data is related to the analysis. (1:50)\n I mean, and I'm thinking about the analysis of the end of collecting all of this information. (1:54)\n How I'm gonna look at the data. (2:01)\n But I thought that, I mean, there's a lot of ways to analyze the data. (2:03)\n One of the ways is to think about the structures within the same song. (2:06)\n So I mean, I could match structures within the same song or essentially the harmonic sequences that I'm gonna make or that. (2:11)\n And so those structures are the data that I'm gonna use to analyze the data. (2:19)\n So those structures. (2:28)\n And right now I'm just doing it sequentially. (2:33)\n But I could try and do it out in patterns like patterns of the sequence of notes. (2:36)\n So that would be...I mean, then you get the rhythmic structure to an extent because the rhythmic structure is often just sets of beats. (2:49)\n And you would detect sets of beats. (3:04)\n You wouldn't necessarily be able to regenerate. (3:06)\n To distinguish triplets from eighth notes, you would have to take out... (3:09)\n Like if you just did it in the way I'm thinking about where you take every second, every third, every fourth note, right? (3:19)\n You wouldn't necessarily get the harmonic structure in there. (3:28)\n But I think you would if you had all of those sequences and you utilize them together in a way that was mathematically correct. (3:31)\n All of these little things need to have the correct information. (3:48)\n I mean, just doing simple things with computers can be annoying anyway. (3:55)\n I was kind of busy today. (4:02)\n In my mind anyway. (4:05)\n I always listen back to this sort of song. (6:55)\n I don't know if it's like a waltz-y type thing. (7:11)\n I can kind of play with it and just do little licks and things like that. (7:19)\n I like doing that. (7:27)\n But with this type of song, I'm not usually very creative, I don't think. (7:28)\n So I tend to want to add the violin sound to add some depth to it. (7:35)\n But when I listen back, it's just so overpowering and so loud. (7:42)\n Maybe I should try to turn the violin sound... studio strings or something. (7:47)\n I'll try that. (7:56)\n I'm not sure if I can do that. (9:35)\n Yeah, so I'm just curious. (11:00)\n One of the first things I will measure will be like repetition within the song itself. (11:02)\n How many of those words actually are the same, right, within the generation? (11:14)\n Because the accuracy or the...I mean, accuracy... (11:24)\n I mean, every piece is going to be different. (11:29)\n But I mean, there has to be some mode that is the same across the song itself. (11:32)\n Because the input is the same, right? (11:48)\n The result should be similar, right? (11:50)\n But it doesn't have to be the same. (11:54)\n It can be creative, but it has to have some distinguishable pattern. (11:56)\n And then with that, you have words. (12:08)\n But the depth that you can create with that will be different. (12:16)\n I mean, whether this all becomes calculatable or feasible, I don't know. (12:26)\n Anyway. (12:35)\n",

        "transcript": " So I don't think I played this song... (0:00)\n I don't think I recorded this song ever. (0:07)\n I mean, I started playing like a year before I started recording it. (0:09)\n I think a year and a half, two years maybe. Something like that. (0:19)\n I mean, I started...I decided for whatever reason to record all this stuff. (0:22)\n I knew I wanted to do some sort of data analytics project. (0:36)\n Because that's what I've done. (0:44)\n I mean, that sort of thing, that sort of thinking. (0:46)\n Trying to understand what's going on essentially. (0:52)\n I don't know. I mean, I know I've always loved music, but I picked the piano. (1:06)\n Just to start playing around again. (1:15)\n I finally got a little bit of the...I mean, I've got quite a bit of data, but... (1:22)\n I haven't started looking at much of it. I finally started to look at... (1:30)\n I tried to extract the fingers. Which fingers are being used at what point, right? (1:37)\n So I have everything timed. Everything that's matched up with the MIDI. (1:43)\n And then I try and look at what...well, I mean, I just did the image analysis. (1:47)\n And I mean, I'm using other people's libraries to detect fingertips. (1:55)\n So I'm going to detect where the fingertip is at what point in time. (2:00)\n And then which finger structures...or I might eventually go into hand structure. (2:04)\n To see what hand structure is better. (2:10)\n I mean, of course, that's all just for my entertainment. (2:14)\n But I mean, that sort of data and utilized with the right analytics. (2:26)\n And analytics should give you a much deeper insight into how to learn. (2:35)\n I mean, with that sort of data, you can improve your learning style. (2:47)\n And that goes for anything like pianos. (2:56)\n That's just the thing that I picked because it's very easily measurable mathematically. (3:00)\n I mean, I haven't gotten into the analytics or any of the deep questions of what is preferred, right? (3:12)\n So what mathematical patterns or whatever you want to call it. (3:22)\n I mean, just the intervals, the volume. (3:28)\n I mean, all of those are just parameters, right? (3:36)\n That some set is preferred for some reason, right? (3:40)\n I mean, I haven't been keeping very good notes on what I prefer and what I don't prefer. (3:49)\n But there's too many things to do. (3:53)\n So anyway, I figured out how to do a little bit of the finger tracking. (3:58)\n And I'll associate that data with the MIDI files eventually. (4:07)\n So I'm still not quite sure yet what I want to analyze with the data. (11:53)\n But I'm getting, I'm making some progress with the storage of the data and the process. (12:18)\n And I think the process is important. (12:34)\n The process is important for learning the piano as well, right? (12:37)\n To try and understand how to do things in a more efficient manner. (12:42)\n I mean, it is a weird thing because it's all about the translation speed. (12:53)\n I mean, if you're working with the music, I mean, some people can remember so well. (13:01)\n I can't remember anything. (13:06)\n I just need to be able to do the process. (13:07)\n I mean, sometimes I'll recall the finger motions, but I mean, my memory is not so great. (13:12)\n I can analyze things in the moment quite well. (13:26)\n But remembering stories and things like that is not my forte. (13:32)\n So I'm just going to do that. (19:37)\n Can't hear her. (20:00)\n Who's dis ganz (20:01)\n I was thinking, I'm spending all this time trying to be able to shorten the time that (25:31)\n it takes to learn this instrument. (25:49)\n Spending a lot of time playing as well. (26:01)\n Much more time playing than analyzing at the moment. (26:05)\n It's fun to play, I guess. (26:15)\n Software is going to change the world in ways we've yet to imagine. (31:15)\n It's true. (31:44)\n How do you do that? (32:01)\n How do you do that safely though? (32:02)\n I mean, that sort of fundamental innovation that is the accumulation of the complexity (32:04)\n of computer technology of today. (32:16)\n How do you understand it, first of all? (32:26)\n There's just too many things. (32:34)\n Too many things. (32:42)\n So many permutations. (32:45)\n So I always liked this song. (37:45)\n This is one of the songs that I got irritated with rhythm when I first started playing. (38:08)\n Like before. (38:22)\n How much did I play? (38:26)\n I don't know if it's similar to now or less. (38:28)\n I think I played a lot of air. (38:37)\n I definitely started playing more after I started recording. (38:39)\n I think I played a lot of air. (42:37)\n I definitely started playing more after I started recording. (42:39)\n is (43:34)\n That was pretty bad. (43:53)\n I don't know why I fell asleep this early. (43:55)\n I was distracted in thought (44:00)\n probably by something I didn't really want to think about. (44:02)\n So I was thinking about what I just did, now I gotta think about what I'm gonna do next. (48:32)\n Well I still have a lot to do with the finger calculation, so I just have the fingers, right? (48:43)\n Like which finger was at what point in what at what time, right? So I still have to load the (48:51)\n MIDI file and match that up with the MIDI file. There's so many like sub quests in a game in (48:59)\n order to actually attain the main goal. (49:15)\n",

(1:13)\n I mean, generally, once you get to that position of the corporation, there are some exceptions. (1:25)\n Most of the people don't have their hands on the operating table, I guess I would say. (1:34)\n So they have kind of an understanding of how things are working, but not a very detailed understanding. (1:46)\n I don't know how to use this just for fun, but I was thinking that a lot of this is, I mean, (2:01)\n the things that I'm thinking about have a wide effect, I guess I'll say. (2:25)\n So I think that's a good question. (7:55)\n Yeah, mostly I talk to myself like... (9:42)\n because I'm trying to essentially annotate the creation of this software (9:47)\n in a way I think I mean the software is very minimal right now but but I see a (9:56)\n lot of potential in a variety of ways but like when I make something I'm just (10:08)\n kind of just randomly thinking about how it would be utilized or how it should be (10:22)\n created and not necessarily thinking about how to monetize something right (10:31)\n because I've never done that very well in my life I've created some interesting things (10:38)\n never been able to turn that into like real money I'm always kind of (10:46)\n I mean it's never been my idea from the start I guess so I include a lot of my (10:58)\n ideas and the things that I help with and some people listen some people don't (11:21)\n but the things that I've created that have been most interesting are the things that I (11:29)\n things that I did myself but they weren't ever used (11:39)\n so the most likely result of this project will be just some sort of intellectual journey of it (17:09)\n but yeah there are a lot of a lot of interesting paths to take (17:35)\n right now I'm kind of on the maintenance path (17:49)\n it's too many details (18:05)\n too many things to accomplish (18:11)\n and I read it in my head and I think it's so much quicker well I'm not (23:35)\n listening I'm not reading all every single note (23:42)\n so I think when you're younger you're I don't know if it has to do with what exactly it has (28:34)\n a more competitive mindset I think once you're older you start to think about well I would like (28:56)\n to see this get accomplished and then you help out wherever you can to to achieve that (29:06)\n I don't know if that's still the case but I think in my generation you tend to try to claim credit (29:17)\n I guess in some way I mean nowadays becoming more obvious (29:32)\n who actually solving the problem but it's still not very it's still in any complex organization (29:47)\n it's very very difficult I mean what should be done if you can start asking yourself that question (30:01)\n I think you can consider yourself lucky (30:21)\n",

        "transcript": " So the study of process improvement or personal improvement, I guess, I mean, it's a, it's (0:00)\n an interesting, interesting thing. (0:18)\n But I do believe, I mean, I kind of like the balance that I'm finding this month, at least, (0:22)\n with programming and playing. (0:34)\n It's been a while since I've really, like, programmed something. (0:38)\n A lot of this stuff is going to be a bit sloppy. (0:53)\n But, I mean, I've always, in programming, I've always been focused on how to accomplish (1:01)\n the thing, not the beauty of the code and the algorithm. (1:09)\n I mean, there are a few things that I really like, one of which is process, right, improving (1:16)\n the overall process of things that create some sort of either feedback mechanism or (1:26)\n improvement cycle, right, within the general flow of things. (1:36)\n That's one thing that I do enjoy finding. (1:45)\n But, yeah, I mean, the focus has never really been on the beauty of code. (1:53)\n There were a couple of algorithms which I liked. (1:57)\n I mean, I liked the way I did things. (2:00)\n I like a few of the algorithms. (2:02)\n I play, like, when I play with mathematics, just because... (2:04)\n And, like, I think I said, you hold meaning in the numbers that you're studying, right? (2:12)\n And in this case, I mean, we have the 12-tone, well, right now I'm just playing with the (2:24)\n 12-tone pattern, right, and trying to understand the sequences and the correlations between (2:30)\n those notes and what... (2:40)\n I mean, I'm going to essentially create a database of that sort of thing to try and (2:44)\n understand. (2:50)\n Anyway... (2:56)\n So, sometimes I like playing with the headphones, but sometimes I do not. (8:17)\n I think I can hear more. (8:27)\n I mean, the speakers are better than the headphones for me. (8:32)\n I think I like the reverberation and something like that. (8:36)\n Maybe I should try and understand why that is. (8:38)\n I think it's just the feeling of the headphones on my ears, probably. (8:41)\n And I associate that with pleasure or pain or whatever. (8:48)\n Slight variation that maybe... (8:54)\n Anyway... (9:02)\n Yeah, I was thinking about the relationship between the mind and the body a little bit. (9:04)\n I mean, I think I've never taken great care of myself, but I think you do have to have (9:15)\n some level of health in order to... (9:21)\n In order to feel... (9:28)\n Decent about going about doing the things that you need to do. (9:32)\n But yeah, I was trying to think why I don't involve more people in what I'm trying to do. (9:40)\n I just... (9:44)\n I've never... (9:46)\n I've never sought out... (9:48)\n I mean, I've sought out ideas, I've sought out concepts, I've sought out those things. (9:55)\n And the people that are related to that... (10:04)\n I get to know and I get to respect a lot of them because there's a lot of interesting people in the world. (10:12)\n But I haven't ever tried to kind of seek out a group or a creative group. (10:22)\n I've joined a lot of groups as a member. (10:28)\n No musical groups, though. (10:36)\n This has been kind of a... (10:39)\n I mean, when I was young, I was like in a band, but just like the school band. (10:44)\n But I never... (10:51)\n I never sought out to become... (10:54)\n Oh, well, I did buy a guitar in college. (11:01)\n I did buy a guitar in college. (11:04)\n Never got very good. (11:08)\n I did a lot more (15:55)\n on the software side (15:57)\n this month than I usually do. (15:59)\n And I don't know... (16:01)\n I mean... (16:03)\n This is kind of a fun project (16:05)\n for me, so... (16:07)\n I don't... (16:09)\n I mean, I spend quite a bit (16:11)\n of time at it recently. (16:13)\n I mean, but... (16:15)\n It's not... (16:17)\n It's not the majority (16:21)\n of my day yet, so... (16:23)\n That's good. (16:33)\n I should definitely... (16:37)\n try to help where I can. (16:43)\n I mean... (16:45)\n There's only so much you can do (16:47)\n if you're not actually (16:49)\n in charge of the organization. (16:53)\n I mean, there's always... (16:55)\n There's always more (16:57)\n to be attempted. (16:59)\n Yes, but... (17:01)\n Where do you find that? (17:03)\n Where do you find that balance? (17:05)\n That's the question. (17:07)\n I mean, generally (17:09)\n you don't run into problems (17:11)\n if you can think of more things (17:13)\n to do (17:15)\n than the people who (17:17)\n are supposed to tell you what to do. (17:21)\n You, we'll take it each of two ways. (19:49)\n 연버ick해 (19:51)\n 는 (19:57)\n вы (20:00)\n We will be this way (20:04)\n I'm a man! (21:15)\n A man if- отношed to the annoucement (21:17)\n I pray that they coud yes, (21:37)\n That's weird. It must have been just from doing this. (22:39)\n That came on down. (22:46)\n Yeah, so I think I'm finding a decent balance between programming and playing. (22:58)\n But, I don't know. (23:06)\n It's hard to say what is a good balance. (23:11)\n So, I am kind of happy I got my new workbook. (27:36)\n I don't actually even really touch the YouTube UI anymore. (27:41)\n I mean, if I can prevent touching anything, (27:48)\n I'm not going to touch anything. (27:55)\n I mean, if I can prevent touching anything, (28:00)\n that's my preference. (28:07)\n Like, in the process, right? (28:11)\n Like, I'm annoyed because I have to touch the screen once before I start playing. (28:14)\n I mean, because there's two steps. There's the button over there. (28:21)\n Well, there's three steps. I have to run the batch process. (28:25)\n Then there's the button. (28:29)\n Then there's this. I have to touch the screen, which is annoying. (28:31)\n But, yeah. (28:36)\n But anyway, I mean, the storage and the analysis process that I do. (28:41)\n So, I mean, it really could be used for a lot of things. (28:49)\n But anyway, I'm happy I got that little piece of what I want working. (28:55)\n ... (33:01)\n This is an interesting process, but I do find communication is a component of music. (33:29)\n And the communicative aspect is... (33:38)\n The way we do it now is kind of weird sharing. (33:42)\n I mean, but it's not... (33:49)\n I don't know. I mean... (33:54)\n It's shared, but you have to really... (33:59)\n Really be enthralled by someone to go listen to their music. (34:05)\n I mean, I've listened to music before, but it's not... (34:09)\n I mean, to me, music is kind of an academic thing at this point. (34:15)\n I mean, it's like... I'm not that great at it, but I understand... (34:20)\n The process that it might take to get better, right? (34:26)\n And... (34:31)\n I understand that that resides within most of the people in the planet. (34:36)\n I mean, there are levels, of course, because inherently there are levels. (34:44)\n But what I... (34:49)\n Like the music that is on the radio, I don't think... (34:51)\n The people that become famous... (34:56)\n The fame and celebrity that becomes associated with music, because it takes us time to listen to that music. (34:58)\n Music is something that's used to kind of get on the same mental state, right? (35:04)\n I mean... (35:10)\n But... (35:12)\n Yeah, the forms of communication that we've had up to this point really inhibits the functional use of music, I guess I'd say. (35:14)\n And I do think it can be functional in a meaningful way... (35:27)\n As in a communication medium, but I'm not quite sure how yet. (35:35)\n I mean, I have some ideas that I'm trying to explore, but I don't know. (35:42)\n So intellectual stimulation is important. (40:39)\n This is one of the toys, music is one of the toys (40:51)\n for intellectual stimulation. (40:55)\n I mean it has that in common with the spoken word I mean essentially a comedy (40:59)\n I mean real-time intellectual stimulation is really what comedy is meant to be (41:11)\n",

        "transcript": " I'm a little frustrated. I thought it'd be easier to modify an existing model. (0:00)\n So I mean the model that I tried to use to detect fingers and match it up with the (0:10)\n the MIDI data and didn't it doesn't I mean it works okay but it's not good enough and I mean (0:25)\n I'm sure it could be tuned. So there were a couple ways I thought about fixing it. One of them was (0:33)\n to extend the camera which I did a little bit but I mean there's no reason to have this data (0:44)\n and collect that data of my kneecaps. So I was thinking. So I tried to extend that but it still didn't (0:50)\n it doesn't detect it well enough in my mind. I mean the hands model because I think it has to do (1:06)\n with the fact that it's partly detecting the wrist and the wrist is not I mean it's not usually (1:13)\n part of the image. So maybe if I include it up to my wrist but I don't want to add that excess data. (1:20)\n I mean I could separately capture this image data but that's a lot of work to do that. So I thought (1:27)\n well maybe I'll improve the model and make the model just for this segment of the hand. So the (1:38)\n hand is what's important here. I mean the logic is really not detecting that piano. It's just trying (1:50)\n to distinguish the hand from the background whatever the background is. But I mean that algorithm (1:55)\n is one of the fundamental algorithms that we're using in image detection. So you essentially (2:04)\n I mean blur the image in a way right or mesh the image with the blocks around it to create a data (2:11)\n structure and then from that data structure you try to understand what it is. I mean I don't know (2:24)\n all the terminology because I didn't study machine learning really but I know the structures and the (2:37)\n way things are done in algorithms and I can understand the logic behind it. I mean I did (2:48)\n something similar to what is essentially now convolutional neural networks right. I did that (2:56)\n like 20 years ago but it was a different data structure. It was not an image data structure. (3:05)\n It was a mapping data structure. But it is difficult. I mean I did think it would be easier. I mean I think I might have to just make my own model. But I don't want to do that. I mean essentially I would just take random images of this and then I have to identify essentially (3:17)\n either the hand structure or the fingertips or I mean the fingertip locations is what I want. So I'd have to identify that somehow right from the images that I take. And then from that data you'll have testing and training data and then you'll verify. (3:43)\n Anyway I mean that's the whole fundamental AI algorithm right. I mean the neural network algorithm whatever you want to call it. It's the attempt to maximize. I mean it's a maximization problem or minimization problem. (4:06)\n And you have a data input and you create this essentially mathematical structure which we call a neural network which is just a set of functions essentially. I mean the details of the functions are, it can be understood more in some ways and less in other (4:31)\n ways depending on the neural network structure that you're creating. But the end result is the same. I mean you've got some input structure that goes through a set of functions and you're just all you're doing at the end, all you're doing to train the neural network is maximizing the, you're running a maximization on the output values that you want. (5:00)\n And I mean you do, people do like adjust the structure of how many functions, what layer is connected to what layer. Which a layer is just a sequence and the function set. (5:25)\n I don't feel productive at the moment. (5:55)\n I think I kind of changed the way I was thinking about the rhythm a little bit at the time (46:38)\n Um (46:44)\n Yeah, I mean (46:53)\n This act is is (46:57)\n Interesting (47:00)\n I mean (47:02)\n I think (47:06)\n There's immediate feedback, right? So so it's like (47:08)\n An immediate (47:12)\n Feedback loop is integrated into the (47:14)\n Into the process. I mean usually (47:18)\n Whatever you're doing. You don't have (47:21)\n an immediate feedback loop (47:23)\n And so (47:27)\n I think there's (47:30)\n There's that time lag (47:33)\n For (47:35)\n For learning I mean I I I do equate music a little bit. I mean learning music is a mimicry of (47:38)\n of (47:47)\n Learning in general (47:49)\n All right, but (47:52)\n I don't know (47:55)\n",

        "transcript": " Yeah, I was thinking about robot generated content essentially, which is going to increase. (0:00)\n I mean, there's only increase, but how do you validate or verify if something's robot generated or not? (0:11)\n I mean, now it's still fairly easy to understand, but I don't think it always will be. (0:23)\n Yeah, that's going to be a problem. I mean, you could do some things like mention. (0:38)\n Well, but that's only live. For recorded content, it's very difficult to tell or authenticate if it was generated or not. (0:46)\n I suspect live content, there's no real way to... (1:05)\n But remarking on events that are occurring at that moment might be... (1:12)\n I mean, I don't think that's that difficult for a computer to do either. (1:20)\n I kind of think what would it be, what would the authentication mechanism to verify if something was computer generated? (1:27)\n I mean, anything that is a disk, we don't have those sorts of authentication mechanisms. (1:42)\n We have security mechanisms to know that the site that's serving the content is the site that's serving the content. (1:50)\n But we don't always... I mean, there's a lot of complexity as to how content is generated now. (1:59)\n And so you don't always know the provenance of the data. (2:07)\n Yeah, that's going to be a problem in the future. I mean, we're not ahead of that. (2:14)\n You have all this content duration in APIs and you're getting libraries to do it. (2:24)\n But we don't have any provenance check to determine a bot account. (2:34)\n I mean, that is one problem that some of the social media networks are trying to figure out how to do. (2:47)\n I mean, once you require human verification, I think that slows everything down. (2:54)\n Because I mean, as a person too, I mean, I want to write scripts that interact with a certain API and not necessarily have to be there all the time when interacting with that API.

(23:35)\n I mean, almost like a jazz piece. (23:50)\n I don't know if that's what was intended.

(24:01)\n I mean, I don't think anybody knows what exactly was occurring. (24:18)\n I suspect it was creation during whatever entertainment session or teaching session. (24:28)\n So I think that's a huge aspect of what's happening now. (33:58)\n I mean, I think that's a huge aspect of what's happening now.

(2:53)\n That's just a different way to think about the parameters that create a tone or a color.

(11:28)\n I got it to the point where I thought that the last couple of times I played it, it was... (11:37)\n I mean, it had some depth and some creativity to it. (11:45)\n I never used to play Chopin that way. I've only (11:57)\n recently done that, where I kind of create while playing (12:04)\n in a meaningful way. I mean, it's not always meaningful. (12:09)\n It's hard to distinguish where I... I mean, I need to make some sort of mechanism where (12:20)\n I can indicate if I dislike or like something. (12:28)\n So I just opened up this book. (20:39)\n I wanted to stop playing Chopin. (20:43)\n Because you're never really going to be satisfied. (20:47)\n I got it to the point where I thought that the last couple of times I played it, it was... (20:51)\n I mean, it's hard to distinguish where I... I mean, it's not always meaningful. (21:07)\n I was thinking about (25:20)\n all the decision making made (25:24)\n in a group or a country (25:28)\n is essentially (25:32)\n codified in language. (25:36)\n But why do we restrict (25:40)\n ourselves to the language (25:44)\n Why do we restrict ourselves to the English language? (25:48)\n I mean, (25:52)\n we should essentially (25:56)\n mandate a certain (26:00)\n logic language. I mean, mathematics is the (26:04)\n fundamentals of a language of logic (26:08)\n for reasoning purposes. (26:12)\n With a basic (26:17)\n understanding of fundamental mathematics, (26:21)\n you can create a language (26:25)\n of essentially like computer code, right? (26:29)\n I mean, it doesn't have to be computer code, (26:33)\n where you can have algorithms and define functions (26:37)\n based on certain parameters and things like that. (26:41)\n And when you try and understand something, (26:45)\n like source code, (26:49)\n I mean, if you read the source code, you can understand how something works (26:53)\n to an extent, right? To the extent that (26:57)\n you're able. And I think (27:01)\n government should work more like that, like decision making (27:05)\n patterns within the public. (27:09)\n But the literacy (27:13)\n literacy for that sort of fundamental logic language (27:21)\n is not there. (27:25)\n And so you have to start from there. You have to (27:29)\n determine, I mean, that's (27:33)\n big changes, but (27:37)\n we need this type of language. We have the capability (27:41)\n to express ideas, (27:45)\n in-depth ideas (27:49)\n in ways that we never did. (27:57)\n . (28:58)\n I'm gonna be good boy (30:51)\n you (31:01)\n I'm gonna be (35:01)\n a good boy (35:03)\n I'm gonna be (35:05)\n a good boy (35:07)\n I wonder if I'll ever see that in my lifetime where we can combine algorithmic logic with (37:29)\n decision making in a group in a meaningful way for the individual. (37:44)\n I doubt it. (37:55)\n",

        "transcript": " So I was a little bit productive. (0:00)\n I don't need to hit those. (0:04)\n I did a little bit with the software to just graph like previous iterations and put that into the workflow. (0:08)\n I mean I hadn't done anything for a while, but I did something. (0:23)\n I kind of liked this. (0:34)\n I might listen to it. (0:43)\n I have a theory on the problem that I had yesterday. (5:43)\n Where the iteration start tag wasn't there. (6:00)\n It's not a very good theory, but I'll check it out. (6:09)\n I think it has something to do with the showing of the screen. (6:15)\n I've got some bad data, but I added this graph here. (6:24)\n I'll add this thing. (6:37)\n Just with the iteration time so I know over a longer period of time what the data looks like. (6:50)\n Right now I'm just graphing iteration speed, but I suspect I'll add more data to that in the future. (7:00)\n So I'll just add this. (9:30)\n What I try to do a lot of times (12:05)\n is put the (12:07)\n A pattern (12:11)\n I'm not really conscious (12:13)\n of what the pattern is (12:15)\n put A pattern (12:17)\n into the existing notes that are on the page. (12:19)\n And I don't know where that pattern comes from. I think I would suspect the pattern comes from (12:24)\n the song that is being played, but I'm not entirely sure. (12:30)\n I'm very interested in the creation aspect of music. (17:19)\n And so I'm trying to understand the patterns that do get created. (17:45)\n I mean, I know there's a certain amount of fundamental music training that most people go through to understand scales. (17:51)\n And generate patterns toward the tendencies that have been tended to before. (18:00)\n And I think there's a lot of wisdom in that idea. (18:09)\n I mean, you're always tending toward what is. (18:16)\n And I mean that in thinking wise, because when you create something new, it's something that has not been before. (18:23)\n So it's an unknown. So there's no way to tend toward it, if that makes any sense. (18:36)\n And so I'm curious whether the creative aspects come from some underlying mathematical principle. (18:46)\n I mean, a lot of it's probably just the movement of the hands, the ease of movement in certain sets of sequences. (18:56)\n And some of it probably comes from the piece being played or the previous piece being played. (19:10)\n Because that's what you're thinking about at the moment. And so that has a high prevalence of, or not prevalence, but a high possibility of being included into the stream of consciousness. (19:20)\n I was glad I did that. (19:44)\n Thank you. (24:44)\n",

(1:38)\n People down here, they're gone crazy. (1:51)\n And I won't care. (2:05)\n Trial and tribulation, I guess I should. (2:12)\n There ain't nothing gonna stop me now. (2:29)\n Mama. (2:42)\n I remember that he said to me, he was saying, (2:59)\n I don't know what to do. (3:47)\n So maybe, he's not gonna show me the way. (3:52)\n I do now what you do, each and every day that you come. (4:06)\n Mama, I'm gonna do a chance again for you. (4:21)\n It depends on you. (4:37)\n Mama. (4:51)\n There's been trials and tribulations, and oh my gosh, (5:50)\n Climbed a mountain just to stand right there for you. (6:03)\n Be ready, Fund21.

(7:22)\n I mean I want to, I want to share a little bit more (7:33)\n I don't know how to do that. (7:39)\n Meaningfully. (7:45)\n I mean, I probably need to... (7:53)\n That might be annoying. (8:00)\n To record myself annotating what I'm doing. (8:03)\n But yeah, oh yeah, I could do that. (8:10)\n I could do that, but that's not something I'm used to doing. (8:17)\n To annotate everything you're thinking or doing. (8:24)\n I mean, I think it... (8:28)\n When you share to that level, it helps other people understand. (8:33)\n In a... (8:44)\n I mean, it becomes a teaching course, essentially. (8:48)\n When you learn and annotate what you are thinking. (8:52)\n I mean, if you turn out to be correct. (8:57)\n I mean, it's... (9:00)\n I mean, but teaching is... (9:02)\n It can be toward any particular goal. (9:05)\n And essentially, it is just annotating what is the thought process. (9:12)\n The steps to achieve a certain outcome when you boil it down. (9:20)\n Uh-huh. (9:30)\n This old tank can hold you down. (10:00)\n I mean, thinking is easy. (10:06)\n I know exactly where I'm going. (10:15)\n Closer and closer, in and out. (10:22)\n In and out. (10:28)\n Oh, say, oh, say. (10:32)\n I have lost my... (10:39)\n He pulled down, he is again. (10:50)\n He is again. (10:55)\n I don't care. (11:02)\n It's rather a simulation to make a flashback. (11:12)\n Maybe not. (11:26)\n I'm so blind. (11:29)\n Say. (11:34)\n I remember daddy said, (11:55)\n I remember, I remember, I remember, (12:00)\n Tears that came down to my eyes. (12:04)\n But you got to go and do it. (12:11)\n You can't just sit back and briefly bow to you. (12:18)\n It's my word, Creele, how I'm bound to everything. (12:33)\n I can't even sure I go in my bed. (12:47)\n He's gonna come home. (13:33)\n There's been trials, been tribulations. (14:37)\n He'd go high back on his chair. (14:44)\n I've climbed a mountain. (14:48)\n I have crossed the river. (14:52)\n Come home. (15:44)\n It's kind of like a dance, a dance with your fingers. (16:14)\n It's very difficult. (16:21)\n It's much more difficult than I... (16:25)\n Well, I mean, I don't really know if I went in with much of an expectation when I went into learning the piano. (16:31)\n So, I mean, I mostly did it just to get back into music a little bit. (16:39)\n But I didn't remember, like, the hours upon hours that it takes to actually get decent at an instrument. (16:47)\n I mean, it's a lot of work. (17:04)\n Or play, whatever way you look at it. (17:12)\n It's just gonna have to wait a while. (17:17)\n Ain't got time for messing around. (17:33)\n It's not my style. (17:39)\n This old man can say something. (17:42)\n Talkin' easy. (17:51)\n I know exactly where I'm going. (17:58)\n Closer and closer every day. (18:04)\n I'm almost moving. (18:12)\n I'm almost there. (18:19)\n People down here, they're gone crazy. (18:31)\n I don't want to get... (18:39)\n There ain't nothin' gonna stop me now. (19:01)\n I'm almost there. (19:16)\n Oh, oh, oh.

        "transcript": " If I could only get what's in my head into the world. (0:00)\n I think that would be meaningful change. (0:12)\n So exhausting now. (0:23)\n I mean I'm only getting started and it's just overbearing. (0:26)\n I mean the amount of work that actually has to go into understanding all of the aspects of this little project. (0:37)\n But it's been so long since I've done the full project. (0:56)\n Generally I'm involved in projects that are smaller on scale I guess. (1:02)\n I just laugh because of the types of projects I'm involved in. (1:16)\n Anyway I wish I could do it faster. (1:26)\n I mean there's one aspect of communicating faster and more eloquently I guess. (1:46)\n And then there's the other aspect of, I mean the other aspect is organization which is the ability to communicate to the people that you want to communicate to when you want to communicate to them. (1:53)\n Which that requires infrastructure. (2:06)\n And that is what is lacking still a lot at the moment. (2:12)\n So I think that's the biggest thing. (2:23)\n Interesting. (8:46)\n Many interesting things to do. (8:52)\n Many interesting things. (8:54)\n But the important (8:58)\n The important (9:00)\n The important word there is do. (9:02)\n I believe (9:06)\n Creation or attempt at creation is (9:10)\n Is a (9:14)\n Is an admirable call. (9:18)\n I mean (9:21)\n Music is (9:23)\n It's fleeting. (9:27)\n Right. (9:29)\n I don't know (9:31)\n I don't know if there are some mathematical properties (9:33)\n That are understood (9:35)\n And that help us understand (9:37)\n Understand (9:39)\n Understand ourselves. (9:41)\n Then I think (9:45)\n It's worthwhile. (9:49)\n I don't see how (9:53)\n I mean (9:57)\n I guess I would say I don't see (9:59)\n It's very hard for me to see the path (10:01)\n From (10:03)\n How (10:05)\n How a piece of music (10:07)\n Feels (10:09)\n To (10:11)\n The reason for its creation in any (10:13)\n Detailed sense. (10:15)\n It's very hard (10:17)\n At the moment (10:19)\n To see (10:21)\n To see that (10:23)\n And I do believe (10:25)\n Eventually (10:27)\n Come closer. (10:29)\nleye (13:41)\n deferene (13:46)\n doo (13:47)\n do (13:58)\ncheck (14:06)\n st (14:08)\n Accordion (15:49)\n So regarding creation, I think it starts when, I mean, we all have a need to be part of a group, part of an organization, whatever that is. (16:05)\n But when that organization can't fulfill your needs with the infrastructure that it has, then I think that is when you start to think to yourself, (16:24)\n well, I can deal with what is there, or I can attempt to help improve the infrastructure. (16:46)\n I guess, I mean, this project is kind of like that. (16:57)\n Even in order to communicate what I'm thinking in my mind, that's going to take some time. (17:08)\n Yeah, so I think, in most cases, people would look at the communication infrastructure. (23:38)\n And be unhappy with it, but try and figure out how to use it. (24:08)\n I don't know. (24:20)\n It's unusable in its current form. (24:27)\n Which is unfortunate, because I think there's a lot of value in the information that is available through other people. (24:33)\n There are some things that you can attempt to do for the good of all, and some things that are under your control. (24:49)\n But with the technology we have on this planet, the problems, in most cases, are solvable. (25:01)\n There's going to be change, of course, but I don't think it's just the organization of everything. (25:12)\n Beyond reach at the moment, with the current communication infrastructure. (25:30)\n Maybe I should think about a problem while I play. (30:56)\n That might be an interesting thing to attempt. (31:04)\n Or think about a problem before I play. (31:14)\n I don't know, I won't use that much time. (31:20)\n I'm thinking about this project. (31:24)\n Creating software related to this type of use case. (31:34)\n I don't know. (31:44)\n I'm much more interested in the creative aspect than I am. (31:54)\n I'm producing something for consumption. (32:04)\n That might be interesting. (32:14)\n I'm thinking about how I should learn piano. (32:24)\n Sharing tool. (32:34)\n",

(16:35)\n I mean, because most likely scenarios I'll be the only one working on it. (16:45)\n I don't know if I want to try and fix that or if I care that much. (16:51)\n So as I was writing some code just now for this project I was imagining, (23:17)\n putting my thoughts towards and I don't know if that's a good practice or not, (23:46)\n but I think it might be because that putting thoughts in words essentially (23:55)\n triggers mental activity and triggers recall I suspect. So if you consciously (24:04)\n do that you have a better chance of remembering or ingesting the knowledge (24:13)\n that you are pondering at the moment I believe.

(0:17)\n That is what I want to kind of understand. (0:23)\n The frequency of the mind is one of the things. (0:26)\n With regards to... (0:32)\n This is one task. (0:35)\n The reading of music and the ease with which that occurs. (0:38)\n It is a memory test of sorts. (0:49)\n I don't know. (0:56)\n I've been playing the same song multiple times.

(0:00)\n Anyway, I should probably, I should probably name the authors better or the composers better. (0:11)\n But I mean like a lot of times if I think well this is probably the only iteration that people of my generation or whatever or people alive now would really recognize. (0:28)\n I don't always put the author. (0:50)\n I heard they were secret corner that David played at Breeze the Lord. (2:21)\n I used to know its beauty except before me. (2:34)\n But I had some and then some more. (2:44)\n And when I broke I couldn't break the door. (2:55)\n Oh it was a cold as hell one day to go away to. (3:05)\n Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah. (3:24)\n Faith was stronger than you needed proof so I started to sing. (3:54)\n Come on. (4:39)\n Baby I've been here before. (5:39)\n I've seen this room and I've walked this floor. (5:46)\n The (6:53)\n long, long time that we've gone was gone. (7:21)\n Now you're just doing something. (7:34)\n And I know you know me. (7:50)\n Honestly the dove was told that every man he draws on is a man. (7:57)\n Not somebody who's seen that life, it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah. (10:43)\n Hallelujah. (12:12)\n Amen. (13:05)\n That seemed like a lot of repeating. (13:09)\n Piano is a good name for the instrument though. (13:13)\n With the additional meaning. (13:18)\n I don't know what you call it. (13:30)\n That's not a homonym but I forget the word anyway. (13:33)\n Because of the meaning of it in musical notation. (13:43)\n And I think you do have to play more quietly in order to pick up the tones that you would expect. (13:50)\n And I think, I mean, that's mostly what the harmonic, synchronization I guess I'll call it, is. (14:06)\n It's, it's, there is a way that you can put together the notes that you are currently hearing. (14:25)\n And try to figure out what the additional notes might be. (14:35)\n And I think, I mean, that's most of the time how music is created as well. (14:40)\n Some people use theory more than others. (14:48)\n But I think the familiarity is really all that's necessary. (14:53)\n Kind of like a language, right? You don't have to, you don't have to be a linguist in order to speak a language. (15:01)\n When I heard there was a secret call, a giant moon, a piece of love, (16:22)\n Oh, now it's beauty and me see for you too. (16:35)\n And it goes like this the fourth and fifth, (16:48)\n Minor for the victory left, (16:58)\n Oh, the baffled kingdom called in the land. (17:07)\n Faith was strong when it was alive, (17:49)\n To see the truth of all that, (17:54)\n And we will be glowing, dancing on the wings. (18:00)\n And she tied me to her kitchen chair, (18:14)\n And said, you will love me in the end, (18:21)\n From the inside out. (18:27)\n Baby, I've been here before, (19:09)\n I've seen this world, and it's been a day and a half, (19:15)\n Can't you see it's gone before? (19:22)\n Oh, it's in the future of Toronto, (19:30)\n Story of the old, the old, (19:38)\n Baffled and confused my honey. (19:47)\n Otherwise the time would let me know, (20:26)\n What was going to be next to me, (20:33)\n When things below, (20:39)\n Not alone, but I too, (20:42)\n Should have been loud too. (20:45)\n So why should we tell them it was a time of year? (20:52)\n Only don't they get moved, (20:59)\n Only every breath that drops on them. (21:08)\n Well, maybe, (23:08)\n I'm not sure if I'm safe to prove it, (23:16)\n Someone else wants to win. (23:23)\n And it's not a cry that you hear at night, (23:44)\n It's not somebody who's seen light, (23:54)\n And it's a cold and it's a broken, (23:59)\n All right, I'm going to sing this one more time. (26:13)\n Seems very different than the last time I played it. (26:18)\n I mean, I think I'm making up more stuff. (26:22)\n I mean, I was definitely making up some of the lyrics, (26:28)\n Because it's just, it's not the right interface. (26:31)\n I mean, I have to track too many things. (26:36)\n If I read the lyrics too. (26:40)\n I mean, it should be presented in a different way, really. (26:44)\n I mean, that's part of what I'm trying to do with the software. (26:47)\n But I haven't gotten to that point yet. (26:53)\n There's actually too many things to do. (26:58)\n A kitchen chair (29:58)\n Broke your throat, oh, she cut your hair (30:05)\n Oh, from your lips she blew (30:15)\n He thought it was yours (30:29)\n Maybe I've been strong before (30:53)\n Seen this room and I've walked this floor (30:58)\n I used to live in a place just like in Haiti (31:03)\n I've seen your flag on the marble arm (31:24)\n Love, it ain't no, ain't no victory (31:33)\n My children, the cold and the looking (31:38)\n For you (31:44)\n There was some time you let me know (32:26)\n Oh, the thought of you and your showy (32:55)\n Thoughts of things you'd never want to show (33:02)\n Well, maybe they're gone (35:09)\n But all I've seen from love (35:15)\n How to shoot somebody who I'm not (35:21)\n And it's not some cry that you hear at night (35:36)\n Not somebody who's seen the light (35:45)\n Who thought it makes a broken (35:51)\n",

        "transcript": " I hope I fixed that for a while. (0:00)\n In order to do the analysis that I want to do, I need the timing data to be correct. (0:07)\n I had a bug, I think, in the analysis. (0:18)\n It's just all kinds of small details. (0:24)\n The MIDI file has different types of messages. (0:28)\n I do this if it's a note, this if it's a petal, blah blah blah, and the source code. (0:34)\n But I had the timing incorrect for the start times and the end times. (0:41)\n One place I was calculating it one way, another place I was calculating it another way. (0:51)\n I mean, that's a very common type of issue, I think. (0:56)\n That general issue of calculating one way in one place and a different way in another place. (1:03)\n I mean, that's why you create functions to share, but often the slight variations that come up make the functions, (1:11)\n I mean, you have the choice. (1:26)\n Well, make the function more abstract, I guess. (1:28)\n Or you just go the quick way of doing calculation. (1:35)\n I hope I fixed that. (1:43)\n I mean, that might also have something to do with the finger issue. (1:49)\n So, I think that's a good way to do it. (3:49)\n across iterations, the same place in the music, right? And how that is spaced out over time. (6:37)\n So I want to see essentially the notes in the iterations and how they vary across iteration. (6:49)\n But in order to do that I need to manipulate the data. (6:59)\n So that I often project now. (10:29)\n I don't think it's necessarily related to music. I project into the future much farther. (10:57)\n Much farther than I used to. I think I guess that comes with age. (11:04)\n But I just have a funny image of the result of this being a bunch of... (11:14)\n like a supporting IT people essentially. But everybody plays the piano very well. (11:22)\n I don't really just think that was a funny image. (11:41)\n I do think music is very much like language. In that it's a real-time audio communication tool. (15:11)\n And that's what humans have used throughout history until very recently. (15:34)\n I mean the majority of humans anyway. (15:43)\n It is like a language but I think it is easier to understand mathematically than the abstract concepts. (15:48)\n I mean I don't know if I'll ever get to that point where I can actually have a decent understanding of the inner workings of all of the neural network algorithms. (16:07)\n I mean I have a basic understanding of that. There you go. (16:23)\n Thank you. (19:37)\n",

        "transcript": " A (0:00)\n So I kind of woke up this morning and wanted to be creative. (6:28)\n I always get sidetracked by little ideas that I have. (6:53)\n I thought it would be interesting to display the github commits along with the timeline of the music. (7:08)\n So I just did a little bit, but then I looked and there was like 100 lines of code. (7:38)\n I don't know what I added. (7:53)\n So how do you get important frame shots from videos? (14:08)\n There's a variety of ways to ingest essentially what happens in some sort of screen sharing session. (14:36)\n But the primary thing is the screen and the voices. (14:48)\n And you should be able to get inferences about what's important, I think, from the audio. (14:54)\n I mean, I don't know if you have to necessarily understand the audio in a deep sense or in a linguistic sense. (15:06)\n I think you can probably find important locations in the video. (15:21)\n I'm trying to cut out the entire editing process of the videos. (15:38)\n I just see how much work it is. (15:48)\n So essentially there's the people who get content consumed a lot, who essentially master the video editing process. (15:55)\n It's not necessarily that, I mean, well, they talk a lot, right? (16:07)\n People who get popular on YouTube talk a lot. (16:12)\n But otherwise, the content in and of itself is not necessarily significantly more interesting than anybody else's. (16:18)\n It's the people who have mastered how to create content, which is sad. (16:35)\n I think that ability to create content should be easier, easier to access, I guess I would say technologically. (16:47)\n But we still don't have any good... I mean, I see the usefulness eventually as a feedback mechanism, a feedback mechanism loop in organizations, in any kind of group. (17:06)\n You have to learn how to separate the messages. (17:29)\n And what if we want to group messages together? (17:37)\n That's an interesting concept. (17:44)\n But I mean, right now, talking across organizations or across groups is not always... (17:54)\n It's a tough proposition. (18:09)\n And to make everybody happy and to allow for more in-depth understanding by sharing that sort of information. (18:14)\n I generally prefer playing with the pedal, but I have to do it a little bit more often. (24:09)\n I think it acts almost like a... (24:34)\n Like going back and forth between using the pedal and not using the pedal. (24:42)\n I think it increases the speed of play generally. (24:49)\n I'll have to check that at some point.

        "transcript": " So I was thinking about why I started this in the first place. (0:00)\n And it does boil down to the ineffectiveness of communication in the world that we currently live in. (0:08)\n There's a complete disconnect by the communication that we could achieve. (0:21)\n And the communication that we do achieve because of the tool sets that are available in the world today. (0:30)\n I mean, I'm envisioning something that's hard to communicate. (0:47)\n I was reading some math. (1:00)\n That reminds me. (1:10)\n I went back and I thought, I mean, math, I've always liked math, but it's so inaccessible for the most part. (1:14)\n I mean, I will say the language, because it is a language of itself. (1:27)\n The mathematical constructs we've created and they're all correlated. (1:40)\n We have, I mean, there is a way you can jump through the documentation. (1:45)\n Well, I mean, documentation, it's definitions of the words that are used in mathematics. (1:51)\n But the understanding of each definition takes a significant amount of time. (1:59)\n And those build on top of each other. (2:09)\n And that is really the definition of that language, I think. (2:12)\n But I think we could do better. (2:19)\n I think we could construct a better language for mathematics in the age of computers. (2:25)\n I don't quite know what I'm thinking of yet. (2:33)\n I do believe that the historical notation, I guess I'll say, leaves something to be desired for the speed of comprehension. (2:37)\n It's the same with music. (2:59)\n I mean, for me, this notation needs to be updated. (3:02)\n I'm not quite sure how yet. (3:11)\n The (7:56)\n pedal is starting to get stuck. (8:15)\n I forget to get a new pedal. (8:20)\n think it's probably good to (8:25)\n mother covered in I know (8:34)\n it's good to (8:41)\n just to relate the mind in that way (8:46)\n it's similar to the stimulation that comes from programming (8:51)\n it's pure (9:05)\n there's so many things I want to do (9:14)\n to improve (9:20)\n there's so many things I have to do (9:26)\n",

(3:39)\n I mean, music is related to the tones and the sequence of tones. (3:52)\n And that's what we've used for communication forever, right? (4:00)\n Until very recently. (4:11)\n Even in the animal kingdom, a lot of communication is via sound. (4:16)\n So, how do I get these ideas out of my head into the world? (6:37)\n And I thought about that a little bit. (6:42)\n And I came to the conclusion that I have to improve the mechanism with which we communicate. (6:48)\n And I wasn't sure how, but I thought I'd just start and try. (7:05)\n",

(0:00)\n Essentially the feedback, I mean I kind of, I want to use, I think I want to use the piano (0:14)\n as well as commentary. So essentially you'll provide feedback with a MIDI controller. (0:24)\n But I mean in order to do that we have to generate some sort of understood language. (0:54)\n And I don't, I mean I guess you could use the keyword, but aggregating the data from (1:03)\n some predefined set of definitions is going to be easier. It's like a vote almost, but a yes no. (1:18)\n But I guess no with some, I can't think of the word. Some subtlety. (1:40)\n So yeah, how do we define a language for feedback and is something like an instrument a good way to attempt that? (11:10)\n I think it might be, I mean the key thing about an instrument is you associate sound with idea. (11:30)\n And when you associate sound with idea, it's like a language. It can become like a language. (11:46)\n And I mean sound is the way that we've communicated for centuries, millennia. (11:56)\n And same as animals, they utilize sound as a, it's the de facto communication medium just because our physical world allows sounds to travel farther than other communication media. (12:06)\n I mean without electronic help. But so sound will remain the core fundamental way that we communicate. (12:32)\n But it has to evolve. And right now we're stuck in an asynchronous communication black hole. (12:44)\n And we have to learn to, I mean we are learning somewhat just from utilizing the tools that are available to us through the technological revolution. (13:04)\n But we have to adapt faster I think. (13:18)\n",

(0:20)\n I mean, I'm trying to generate the mechanism for feedbacks. I finally got to the point where I can collect MIDI data from the web page. (0:29)\n I didn't save that MIDI data to a file, but I've not saved it yet to where I want to save it. (0:52)\n And I'm not quite sure how I'm going to utilize it yet.

(22:10)\n But I didn't believe that the software that I'm doing is probably... (22:16)\n Has the potential to be more useful than any music I might produce. (22:22)\n But I've never been able to...

(23:16)\n So I was envisioning the generation of essentially the sheet music from the MIDI files and then (31:38)\n I was thinking that would essentially automate the process of any updates because you know (31:59)\n a feedback loop and if you played the same sequence like on one of these, I don't like (32:07)\n that chord right there, I don't know why, but probably could have been playing it wrong.

(0:08)\n Because I've been looking at the time data in the last couple of songs. (0:13)\n Like, the speed was not trending down. (0:18)\n Which seems odd to me. (0:25)\n I mean, I'm just assuming that as you play more, the speed will go up. (0:30)\n I mean, the speed was not that much slower than the previous times. (0:43)\n But it was definitely slower. (0:50)\n I don't know if that is the data irritated me or the actual sound of the music produced. (0:57)\n It's very difficult to segregate the feedback in that way.

I mean I can increase the speed but the noise increases with (16:47)\n it. I mean the noise increases with it because I developed a pattern of I mean the mind working (16:55)\n faster than the process of ingesting the music. But I really need to understand those patterns (17:14)\n that are going into the noise. How much of it is noise? How much of it is signal? I mean the (17:24)\n noise and signal I have to separate out by taking. And there will be some understandings (17:36)\n of the motions of the hands related to noise.

        "transcript": " So I kind of wanted to sing something but I can never concentrate enough on the voice. (0:00)\n Maybe I need to, I think maybe that's another level of familiarity with the piece, to be so familiar with the piece that you just can focus on your voice and what you do with your voice. (0:11)\n Multiple processing systems, parallel processing systems, that's essentially, I mean you can equate music ingestion to that sort of thinking. (0:31)\n A lot of processes in the world are serial for having, mostly because we have never been able to achieve them parallelly. (0:57)\n So now those sorts of things will start to appear more and more. (1:18)\n Mama, I don't have time for this. (1:29)\n I'm just gonna have to wait a while. (1:41)\n I ain't got time for messing around. (1:50)\n And it's not my style. (2:00)\n This old town can slow you down. (2:06)\n People talking their ears away. (2:16)\n I know exactly where I'm going again. (2:27)\n Closer and closer and more. (2:36)\n I'm almost there. (2:57)\n People down here think I'm crazy. (3:17)\n But I don't care. (3:30)\n I've heard my share. (3:52)\n There ain't nothing gonna stop me now. (4:05)\n I am almost there. (4:12)\n Daily freedom. (4:35)\n Fair tears, fair control. (4:45)\n For you, girl, I hope you have been there. (4:55)\n It all depends upon you. (5:09)\n A great heart reaches every day. (5:22)\n Now, please, may God always go your way. (5:34)\n Do you know most things have backstabbed anyone? (5:47)\n Almost there. (6:07)\n People gone, gone, gone, gone. (6:29)\n Yeah, we're here. (6:33)\n Eventually, (8:44)\n soется down my throat. (8:45)\n Sopi و (8:47)\n Can't forget it. (8:51)\n So惜ооу. (8:53)\n So widely, (8:57)\n or so extraordinarily. (8:59)\n So인이, (9:03)\n or so semaines pe. (9:05)\n So I wanted to sing something because I was thinking about (9:08)\n the voice and it's such an important aspect of the impression of the person as well. I mean music (9:36)\n of course as well and what is it in a voice that creates that intrigue? I mean of course the words (9:55)\n that are said are important in certain cases. Music is not necessarily important that you hear (10:08)\n the words. It doesn't get any easier. (10:18)\n Why am I? I don't have time for dancing. (10:49)\n That's just gonna have to wait a while. Ain't got time for messing around. (10:53)\n And it's not my style. This old town, it got just slowing down. (11:11)\n People taking their ears away. (11:31)\n I know exactly where I'm going. Closer and closer every day. (11:41)\n And I'm almost there. Oh I'm almost there. (11:57)\n People down here think I'm crazy. (12:12)\n Tries and tribulations. (12:43)\n I've had my fill. (12:48)\n There ain't nothing gonna stop me now. (13:00)\n Oh, I'm almost there. (13:07)\n I remember that he said you made my world free my tears. (13:15)\n Something true. (13:44)\n Oh, you still got one thing left. (13:53)\n Where the better place to go? (13:59)\n I'm for sure the only way. (14:30)\n Just do the things you want to. (14:40)\n Look out, they might lead somewhere. (14:50)\n I'm almost there. (15:04)\n People gone, gone, gone. Everywhere. (15:22)\n Oh, oh, oh. (15:33)\n There's been trials, been tribulations. (16:13)\n You know I've had my fill. (16:35)\n But I've climbed some mountains. (16:39)\n Now I've crossed some oceans. (16:44)\n And I see you. (16:51)\n I kind of used my voice a little more that time. (18:08)\n I usually don't. (18:18)\n I think I was thinking while I was playing the end of that piece that finger fails. (18:22)\n I had a few finger fails at the end of that piece. (18:35)\n And I thought, I don't know that. (18:38)\n I mean, how do you distinguish between the aspects? (18:41)\n The wrong fingering. (18:50)\n I think that's probably better to do in time when you notice that. (18:53)\n When you notice a better fingering. (18:59)\n Because when you're listening to it, it's hard to distinguish over the period of time (19:02)\n unless you're really focusing on the fingers. (19:07)\n So I think you should probably use the same language during creation. (19:11)\n I think you should use the same language during creation. (19:19)\n That's just gonna have to wait a while. (19:34)\n Ain't got time for messing around. (19:42)\n And it's not my style. (19:49)\n This old clown can slow it down. (19:54)\n Thinking, thinking, easy way. (20:03)\n I know exactly where I'm going. (20:12)\n I'm getting closer and closer every day. (20:19)\n I'm almost there. (20:28)\n Oh, I'm almost there. (20:35)\n People down here, they got breathing. (20:42)\n Oh, but I don't care. (20:55)\n Contribulations, I've had my fill. (21:03)\n There ain't nothing gonna stop me now. (21:20)\n Now you know that the city (21:43)\n can tell you and me too. (22:06)\n Oh, but sometimes you can forget. (22:15)\n It might happen to you. (22:28)\n Work real hard each and every day. (22:38)\n Now things they might sometimes go your way. (22:47)\n Most of the time. (22:56)\n Oh, you fool. (22:59)\n Life's hard, you're used to it and don't play the fool. (23:04)\n Oh, almost there. (23:17)\n People gone come from everywhere. (23:21)\n Oh, I'm almost there. (23:36)\n Oh, I'm almost. (23:43)\n There's been trials, been tribulations. (24:14)\n You know I've had my fill. (24:42)\n I've climbed a mountain. (24:50)\n Oh, let me speak to you. (24:53)\n I've seen things too. (24:58)\n Oh, almost there. (25:12)\n There you sit out in the distance. (25:19)\n There. (25:38)\n Oh, it's only a dance. (25:41)\n Oh, almost there. (26:11)\n",

(12:47)\n I gotta think about everything just like you (12:50)\n People gone come from everywhere (13:12)\n Oh, I'm mostly (13:22)\n There's been trials and trials (13:52)\n There's been trials and tribulations (14:19)\n But I've climbed a mountain (14:29)\n Oh, I've walked a desert (14:34)\n I'm with you (14:39)\n Almost there (14:53)\n Oh, I'm almost not quite there (15:09)\n Almost not quite there (15:17)\n Almost not quite (15:31)\n Maybe not (15:40)\n So I remember now why I wanted to play this because I was thinking about it before I went to sleep last night (15:57)\n And I don't usually do that. I'm usually thinking about something else (16:06)\n Like people normally would things to take care of other things they have to take care of in life (16:14)\n But yeah, I was thinking a little bit about it so I thought I'd play it again (16:22)\n Because I (16:30)\n I kind of remembered the lyrics and I was thinking a little bit about the lyrics (16:33)\n What's the lyrics on song so far? (16:37)\n I don't know, I was a little bit made up (16:40)\n But I think that is the iteration type that I want to have with vocal (16:48)\n With vocal songs, right? Because you want to make it alive, right? (16:56)\n And in order to do that you have to essentially be creating during the iteration (17:03)\n And then have that data instead of like this is fixed. I'm working on fixed data right now (17:13)\n But this should be iterative (17:19)\n So when I'm reading the music again I should read it kind of from a basis of what I did the previous time (17:24)\n But you have to take into account the reading speed and which notes are emphasized, right? (17:37)\n I mean so essentially the iterations of the song should rewrite every time you play the song (17:44)\n It should rewrite the song (17:50)\n That's a ways down the road I think (17:53)\n I'm not quite sure how far (17:59)\n A lot of this programming I can somewhat envision (18:02)\n But in order to like anything between the time you envision something to the time you can actually accomplish it (18:08)\n To accomplish it, right? Is often a long period of time (18:17)\n Sometimes you can't accomplish things, right? (18:27)\n But music is all subjective (18:35)\n I mean there are truths in music which go across individuals, right? (18:40)\n But I'm not sure there's... (18:49)\n I'll probably just confuse things if I can get in (19:01)\n Mama, I don't have time for dancing (19:10)\n I'm just gonna have to wait a while (19:18)\n Ain't got time for messing around (19:26)\n And it's not my style (19:31)\n This old town, it gots slowing down (19:36)\n People talking, they's away (19:42)\n I know exactly where I'm going (19:52)\n I'm getting closer and closer every day (19:59)\n I'm almost there (20:16)\n People down here think I'm crazy (20:24)\n I wanna win (20:43)\n I've tried my tribulations (20:55)\n I've had a few (21:06)\n I ain't in the mood to talk about them now (21:18)\n But you, you might too (21:24)\n I remember daddy said one day (21:36)\n Oh, fairy tales do come true (22:06)\n But you gotta make them happen (22:16)\n They ain't coming to you (22:28)\n Work real hard each and every day (22:37)\n Each and every night, listen for my way (22:45)\n Do any things I do (22:53)\n Will count on what I'm affected by (23:05)\n I'm almost there (23:23)\n People don't come home, don't live with you (23:33)\n I'm (23:53)\n There's been trials, been tribulations (24:41)\n You know I've had my share (24:48)\n I've climbed a mountain to be right here (24:55)\n Maybe I'll never have it again (25:03)\n I am almost (25:18)\n",

(0:25)\n Yeah, I had only done it so that you can give feedback one time, but I should be able to give feedback (0:34)\n multiple times if necessary regarding different aspects.

(1:12)\n I'm envisioning a network of interactions based on what people are thinking about and working on. (1:20)\n I think a lot about the current state of media. (1:36)\n Essentially, everyone is just a consumer of media. (1:44)\n The question becomes, how do we change that?

(2:19)\n I mean, it should be a combination of a variety of things. (2:26)\n But often it is not due to the fact that communication to accomplish that is insufficient.

(1:04)\n Because I mean, that's an easy... (1:13)\n kind of an easy win as far as what you're most comfortable with, with regards to speed.

(0:15)\n And usually it's the reading that is slower than the hands. (0:22)\n It's hard to separate those two things. (0:30)\n Which is actually the source of the problem. (0:36)\n But yeah. (0:52)\n I have an annoying problem with this MIDI, the recorded MIDI. (0:55)\n If I utilize any other voices, it can't be read by the HTML JavaScript MIDI library that I'm using. (1:00)\n So I think I'm going to have to change that library. (1:21)\n But I really hate going into other people's libraries and changing things because you can have unexpected consequences. (1:25)\n So I try to avoid it. (1:37)\n But it seems to be the shortest path to a solution. (1:39)\n I think I should put it in the source library. (1:47)\n I'll pull that right off. (1:54)\n It might already be in there anyway. (2:05)\n So right now we have a horrible feedback system. (9:35)\n This feedback system is not great. (9:50)\n I wish I could be more accurate. (10:08)\n I've been doing the feedback while I listen, which is why I haven't been listening very much. (10:12)\n Because I want to create a feedback loop of some kind within the logic.

(2:36)\n But as a young person a lot of times that can be misconstrued as being told what to do. (2:41)\n Which nobody likes. (2:53)\n Hmm. (3:01)\n Tut, tut, tut (4:29)\n Oh, now you're just another brick in the wall (4:57)\n Oh, now you tell me there's no control (5:27)\n The darks and vines are in the classroom (5:44)\n Teacher leave those kids alone (5:58)\n Hey teacher leave those kids alone (6:13)\n Yeah, so I was thinking about the... (9:01)\n So the visualization part is fairly straightforward (9:03)\n I mean, that's a lot of work, but... (9:07)\n I'm thinking more about the aggregation (9:10)\n I eventually want to aggregate the data (9:15)\n in some sort of sequential way (9:20)\n and then potentially predict future outcome (9:25)\n That's essentially what all these algorithms are doing (9:30)\n I'm curious (9:36)\n I mean, all this stuff like GNN, the graph neural network (9:43)\n The graph neural network (9:49)\n Essentially when I did the mapping project that I did (9:54)\n I was making a rudimentary graph neural network (9:57)\n But I did not have a predicted outcome (10:02)\n I essentially generated the outcomes (10:07)\n I was grouping by deviations (10:11)\n So there's a lot of mapping data that's grouping by deviations (10:18)\n I don't know, but I decided I need to study some of this stuff (10:31)\n People have done a lot to work with those algorithms (10:34)\n They're so complex now (10:37)\n But the way I do it is I just kind of look at the samples (10:40)\n that are being utilized (10:46)\n It's a quicker way to a general understanding (10:52)\n of the thing that you're looking at, whatever that thing is (10:57)\n So I'm going to go ahead and start (11:10)\n We don't need no education (11:37)\n Teacher, the kids are lost (12:07)\n We don't need no education We don't need no thought control (13:24)\n Leave them kids alone (13:54)\n All in all it's just a wall (14:24)\n A wall breaking the wall (14:34)\n The final result (16:44)\n Last of the time (16:48)\n Because the final result usually becomes apparent (16:54)\n But understanding the process is more important to fundamental understanding (17:02)\n Education (17:14)\n Even myself, I don't quite understand, like even playing a song (17:16)\n Where I go as far as preference is concerned (17:28)\n There's moderately more familiarity so I think just that is what becomes preference (17:36)\n There is something about speed I don't know (17:52)\n I don't know (17:58)\n I can't remember (18:00)\n Education (18:04)\n We don't need no thought control (18:24)\n No dark sarcasm in the class (18:40)\n Teachers leave those kids alone (18:52)\n Hey teacher, leave them kids alone (19:02)\n I don't need no education (20:04)\n We don't need no thought control (20:12)\n Teachers leave those kids alone (20:34)\n",

        "transcript": " So I figured I'd play a couple of Simon and Grafton Gooselms before I... (0:00)\n I think I'm getting a better balance of listening, creating and programming. (0:15)\n I mean, there's so many interesting things to do with IT, it's hard to know if what you're doing is having good results in something. (0:25)\n But I've definitely learned a lot by doing this. (0:40)\n I do want to kind of utilize the neural network libraries a little bit. (0:51)\n But I think we really have to have an open... I mean... (1:07)\n I don't know if everything should have to be open essentially. (1:20)\n Like... (1:26)\n I'm not sure if that's the best policy or not. (1:33)\n But I think probably... I mean, this sort of technology is an accumulation of technology that is not very well understood even by the best minds on the planet. (1:41)\n And that in and of itself is problematic. (2:01)\n But then to allow that which we have minimal understanding of to not be open to public scrutiny. (2:11)\n I mean, we've already done that with the first iteration of people who were able to employ IT to the advantage of themselves, right? (2:25)\n All the IT companies that got rich, the biggest ones are all using other people's data. (2:40)\n And that in and of itself is... We've already been building a computer-like brain since the first computer. (2:54)\n I mean, it's just the functionality that we understand and don't understand. (3:09)\n And I think with this neural net... I don't even think the people that are creating them understand it very well. (3:19)\n And I think that's problematic. I think we need to... We all need to... (3:27)\n I mean, at least a large subset of people need to understand the fundamentals behind it. (3:34)\n And that's going to happen at some pace. But the policy that we can create is that any... (3:43)\n I mean, we need a data format standard first. I mean, there are a couple that are flying around. (3:55)\n But we need the policy that the models must be open and available. (4:01)\n I mean, for the most part, they have been. But I don't think the refined models that are being used are made open. (4:13)\n I mean, you can't make open the entire data set of essentially the scoured data, (4:31)\n but either a representation of the model or the source that is generating whatever it is. (4:39)\n I think that's important. (4:51)\n That we get that part started. (4:55)\n So how can we build an iterative history into the neural network? (11:51)\n I mean, it's already doing that, but you have to have that encoded somehow. (11:59)\n I mean, I'm just trying to think of what the data is that we need to track. (12:09)\n I mean, I think everything should be open. (12:15)\n And I mean, some people have started to try and make a repository for neural networks to explain them and to document them. (12:17)\n But I don't know that we have any standard. (12:27)\n We really need to make a standard as quickly as possible for that. (12:33)\n And to have a site for the documentation of that. (12:37)\n Unfortunately, the technology is all broken up. (12:43)\n I mean, we really need to create a standard now. (12:49)\n It's probably not going to happen now. (12:57)\n So you're going to have a bunch of us. (13:05)\n But what I want to say is we need to be documenting the usage of any neural network that is created. (13:07)\n I think because I think we do have to treat it kind of as an entity in and of itself. (13:27)\n And we have to have some sort of framework surrounding that. (13:35)\n I mean, just like we have laws for animals. (13:45)\n But the most important thing for right now is to track what is being used and how many times it's being used and who. (13:53)\n I mean, that may seem overbearing. (14:01)\n But I think we have to find a way to do that reasonably. (14:17)\n Tell to repeat with. (25:45)\n",

(0:22)\n For now, those are the two that I want to do. (0:26)\n But I've not fully thought out the way that I want to do that. (0:33)\n One of the ideas is to use essentially the white keys for diatonic scale, essentially for vector movement, (0:39)\n and then the pentatonic scale for rotational movement in an exponentiated fashion. (0:55)\n I don't know. I mean, I would like for there to be symmetry between the way that it's used. (1:05)\n And I think that's probably a good way for that, but I don't know if there's a symmetry to that when utilizing feedback. (1:14)\n Maybe there is. You can have different angles, meaning different things, and just have a circle with a word, a sentiment, meaning chart. (1:24)\n And then based on the angle and then the vector that you go. So you'll go up and down the vector, but then to move between sentiments. (1:40)\n Maybe that would work. (1:56)\n",

(0:35)\n I've been learning a little bit about reinforcement learning. (0:41)\n I'm not sure what... (0:46)\n ...the more significant portion of, like, what everybody talks about. (0:51)\n Like, today, when learning machine learning, someone mentions chat GPT or whatever, (0:58)\n essentially, it's the GPT algorithm, which I think was not developed by them, (1:04)\n but with the combination of essentially an internet scour, which, I mean, the best people at that are Google and Microsoft. (1:11)\n But the combination of that with reinforcement learning, but how do you do the reinforcement learning? (1:22)\n I think is the key. (1:33)\n And I think, I mean, I don't know if they were forward-looking from that sense, (1:35)\n and they're actually utilizing everything that everybody's inputting into the system as reinforcement learning. (1:47)\n Right? Because essentially, you have a question, you ask a question, it gives you an answer. (1:53)\n And then, depending on how much you like that answer, people will ask follow-up questions. (1:59)\n And that's essentially a form of reinforcement learning. (2:04)\n And that, I think, is actually more valuable than the initial scan. (2:07)\n Right? Because the initial scan of information, anybody can do that. (2:19)\n Technologically, it's not that difficult. I mean, we've been doing it for many years. (2:23)\n But you need a lot of resources nowadays. You need a lot of resources. (2:31)\n I mean, in the future, you probably won't need that many resources.

(5:01)\n Essentially, eventually (5:06)\n But we'll see (5:10)\n If I ever get there (5:13)\n I'm just setting up a different machine for this (5:20)\n I'm trying to document, I mean, because I've worked my whole life essentially in explaining (5:24)\n To other people how computers work (5:31)\n In one way or another (5:36)\n I don't really want to do that with this (5:40)\n I mean, that's all the projects I've done (5:44)\n I've just done kind of to satisfy my inner curiosity (5:49)\n I mean, all the projects I've done (6:01)\n Where I was essentially the only participant (6:05)\n I mean, everyone's around, I've worked with somebody outside of work (6:10)\n I wish I could choose what everybody was doing (6:14)\n I think there are many people in that situation now (6:25)\n I'll be home for Christmas (6:45)\n You can rely on me (6:58)\n Please explore and whistle-to (7:08)\n And presents on the tree (7:22)\n For Christmas Eve (7:32)\n I'll find you (7:38)\n You can rely on me (7:50)\n I'll be home for Christmas (7:59)\n Only in my dreams (8:11)\n I forgot, I kind of want to listen (8:17)\n Because every time after I play Chopin (8:27)\n Like before I kind of realized (8:31)\n It was nicer than it was before (8:35)\n I mean, I haven't played this before but (8:38)\n I got the Christmas one now (8:42)\n That's getting closer (8:47)\n The feedback process for the AI learning audience (8:52)\n We need to understand (9:00)\n I mean, I think everybody needs to understand computers better (9:04)\n We should be teaching (9:09)\n Computer literacy (9:15)\n And school (9:19)\n That's kind of a divisive subject (9:23)\n I'm not sure why (9:33)\n I mean, it's hard, right? (9:37)\n Learning about computers (9:40)\n And so (9:43)\n The level that you can achieve is generally limited (9:46)\n I mean, it's limited to the convenience of the human-machine interface (9:51)\n And the combination of that with the (9:57)\n I call it intuitiveness (10:01)\n I mean (10:04)\n That's such a simple summary of what it actually is (10:07)\n I mean, it's an accumulation of knowledge from software sets (10:15)\n Sets of software, I mean, software developers (10:21)\n They make other software developers because (10:23)\n Well, first of all, they take the code from somewhere (10:26)\n And then they (10:30)\n And the user also expects mimicry (10:32)\n If a user is used to certain functionality (10:35)\n They say, I want this functionality in the software (10:38)\n And so people in software make it (10:40)\n And so there's a huge aspect of mimicry in software as well as (10:42)\n As well as music (10:48)\n It's much more difficult to discern in software because (10:51)\n Because unless you know all the subsets of software that has led to (11:00)\n X, Y, Z, just kind of like a gamer (11:06)\n I don't usually play computer games (11:10)\n But the world, I mean, it's a huge world of computer games (11:14)\n Unless you know that set of data, essentially (11:20)\n It's difficult to adapt (11:28)\n So I think we all have to try and keep up with technology (11:31)\n To some extent, to the best of our can (11:38)\n I mean, it's hard (11:42)\n But so are many things in life (11:44)\n But technology, it strives to make things easier (11:47)\n And I mean, I don't think everybody realizes exactly how much easier things are now (11:56)\n Than they were decades ago, right? (12:03)\n Oh yeah, I think I didn't look at why that didn't get fixed (12:10)\n Romans (12:17)\n I am movein' me home for for Christ's sake (12:33)\n You can count on me (12:42)\n Please have some, some tolling presence on the tree (12:58)\n Christmas inka will find (13:24)\n I'll be home for Christmas (13:38)\n And only in my dreams (14:00)\n Wondering something about like I don't know other people's experience playing (14:48)\n playing piano very much so I don't read about it, but (14:54)\n Show me some pieces I'm starting to kind of (15:02)\n Well, I mean I can't play fast the the speed like like a two-page piece (15:13)\n Was just (15:23)\n Like the slow one I got substantially faster (15:30)\n And all the slow but but it's two pages there is two pages of content and (15:44)\n And I think (15:49)\n I think the two pages (15:53)\n To have minutes and then the fast one is still like five minutes (15:56)\n Quite I mean it might have to do with the (16:04)\n Usage of the fingers. I mean a lot of the slower pieces they don't use (16:08)\n Multiple fingers (16:13)\n Mean single note movement and it was multiple movement (16:18)\n If (18:02)\n Present (19:02)\n",

I think it (0:08)\n was because of lag in the machine that the audio quality decreased. I mean I'm (0:16)\n not running this on any high-spec machine. It's just like a standard laptop. (0:28)\n Interesting. I think it was too much open probably because the analyze... (0:34)\n yeah the analyze, it's still listening to the video as well. Probably that creates some sort of lag. (0:57)\n I'm not sure. That should be real time I think. I mean priority should be given to the audio. (1:06)\n I think they have that running like a higher priority thread. (1:25)\n I like the title. (1:29)\n Now is the time to seize the day. (3:25)\n Send out a call and seize away. (4:01)\n Send out, send out a call. (4:08)\n Send out a call and join the fray.

(8:08)\n That's not quite as lyrical as the stuff I've played from him before. (8:39)\n I really need to change this mechanism for my start and stop timing. (8:49)\n But I have been thinking about the machine learning aspect of technology. (9:00)\n I do believe the feedback mechanism needs to be analyzed and the attribution mechanism, (9:23)\n where the data was sourced from, is not, is problematic, I believe. (9:36)\n I mean, I've been thinking about how, like, OpenAI or something made the software that they did, (9:46)\n and having no attribution. (9:57)\n I mean, at least if you do like a search on Google, it attributes the content to the creator of the content. (10:03)\n I mean, the creator of the content is the owner of the website. (10:13)\n I mean, the original creator of the content, it should be sourced in some way, right? (10:16)\n And I think we have a problem. (10:23)\n We have a source management problem. (10:28)\n I don't mean like source code management. (10:33)\n I mean, the origin of data. (10:36)\n We have an origin of data problem. (10:41)\n And a long time ago, it was too hard to reproduce content or to refactor, I guess I'll say, content. (10:44)\n But now it's become so easy. (10:57)\n It's so easy, I mean, to ingest and refactor content in a variety of ways. (11:03)\n And so we really need to try and do a better job of sourcing content. (11:13)\n It's going to be so problematic. (11:28)\n We can't do that better soon. (11:31)\n Because that is part of the reason for the confusion that we have in the world. (11:36)\n It is you don't have good content sourcing mechanisms. (11:48)\n It's not built into the content ingestion. (11:53)\n Unfortunately, content creation has become so simple. (12:02)\n Anyway. (12:15)\n Open the gate and cease the day. (12:23)\n Don't be afraid to cease the day. (12:35)\n You're full of fear and fear. (12:45)\n See what's real. (12:51)\n Is the time to see the day. (13:45)\n Send out a call and seize the day. (13:57)\n Now is the time to join the fray. (14:03)\n Things will be written. (14:09)\n Heisman will show them. (14:14)\n Let us all seize the day. (14:19)\n Right away.

(0:07)\n And I'm not very good at using them, but I'll try to be more accurate to the best of my ability. (0:16)\n Okay, but I just don't like language as a language, I mean the way that we use it. (0:26)\n Anyway, yeah, but it's hard to make... (0:41)\n It's hard to make language. (0:46)\n Anyway, I decided to do the simple rag model on this chatting fad that everybody's all excited about. (0:56)\n I mean the stuff behind the general network logic is here to stay. (1:15)\n But the application to language is just one of the applications I think we're going to see. (1:22)\n But I mean it's just an application so far for the most part, an application to text that is built into these models (1:32)\n that are now becoming accessible to most people to do with. (1:47)\n I'll say, well, I'm trying to... (1:53)\n I mean, which it's going to become more prevalent and there's going to be applications generated for that sort of thing. (1:57)\n But I'm not sure the speed at which they will catch on. (2:12)\n It's going to be an interesting paradigm. (2:21)\n I mean I already know from the search that you can go... (2:26)\n Like most things that are easily swappable, like search engine wars a while ago and then the browser wars. (2:32)\n I mean they're... (2:48)\n One thing is essentially interchangeable. (2:51)\n Then you can fall out of favor quite quickly. (2:55)\n The stuff I've been thinking about will come out of those sorts of applications. (9:25)\n Which will be services for a while and some of them will stick around, some of them will fade away quickly. (9:31)\n But I mean I do like my initial thinking about the... (9:45)\n It's kind of a metaphor within a metaphor. (9:57)\n The way that we're misusing the technical term to represent something which will affect so much more. (10:05)\n But anyway, I think of these interactions as a language. (10:26)\n Essentially the interaction aspect of it is like a language. (10:38)\n How much the decision making process resembles our own mind is kind of irrelevant. (10:44)\n It's not irrelevant in the sense that... (10:54)\n It should be ignored but it's irrelevant in the sense that as long as we understand what is occurring well enough. (10:58)\n Right now, I mean people... (11:10)\n People don't understand very well if what's being communicated is actually communicated. (11:14)\n So coming to consensus is very difficult in any reasonable amount of time. (11:34)\n Simply due to the number of people and the inefficiency of language itself. (11:46)\n So you need something beyond the language that we have developed in order to even make intelligent decisions about the kinds of things that are occurring today. (11:56)\n So I don't know if it was a good decision to... (17:49)\n Communicate by using kind of... (17:55)\n I mean... (17:59)\n Nothing is concrete in my head but I'm envisioning what I suspect the future to be like. (18:03)\n I'm trying to create something that exists in that future. (18:15)\n I don't know.

And so, I don't know, maybe (0:26)\n getting rid of some of the noise from the mic will improve that. But I'm not sure, it might just be my mumbling way. (0:34)\n Why don't you come to your senses? (1:26)\n You've been out riding fences for so long. (1:41)\n I don't know. (1:59)\n I wanna know that you've got your reason. (2:06)\n Things that are pleasing you, you need to know somehow. (2:24)\n Should draw the queen of diamonds more. (2:48)\n Should beat you if she's able. (2:57)\n The queen of hearts is always your best bet. (3:06)\n Seems to me some fun things have been laid upon your table. (3:18)\n But you're only one, the ones that you can't give. (3:34)\n Desperado. (3:49)\n Oh, you ain't getting no younger. (4:00)\n The pain and your hunger, they're driving you home. (4:11)\n And freedom, oh freedom, that's just some people talking. (4:26)\n The prison is walking through this world of alone. (4:44)\n Feet get told in all the time. (5:05)\n The sun will shine. (5:16)\n The night time from the day. (5:24)\n You're losing all your wise and long hope. (5:45)\n Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away? (5:53)\n Desperado. (6:10)\n Why don't you come to your senses? (6:16)\n Come down from your fences. (6:29)\n Hope you're here again. (6:35)\n It's raining, you'll see it's raining out. (6:42)\n But there ain't nowhere to go. (6:47)\n If it hurts, let somebody love you. (6:53)\n But if it's somebody loves you, before it's too late. (7:06)\n So I tried a little bit of the Hugging Face libraries. (7:36)\n And I did that because they had, I mean it's hard to say what's the easiest way or whatever, but they had a little bit of an example about reinforcement learning. (7:57)\n And that's one of the most important aspects of machine learning, or one of the most important aspects of what I would like to see done. (8:09)\n So I was curious about it. (8:25)\n Desperado. (8:56)\n Why don't you come to your senses? (9:01)\n You've been out riding fences for so long now. (9:08)\n Boy, you're a hard one. (9:24)\n I know that you've got your reasons. (9:29)\n Things that are pleasing. (9:39)\n Things that are pleasing you can help you somehow. (9:48)\n Don't you draw on a queen of diamonds, boy. (10:11)\n She'll be true if she's able. (10:17)\n The queen of hearts is always your best friend. (10:27)\n It seems to me some fun thing laid upon your table. (10:46)\n But you're the only one that you can get. (10:59)\n The Esperado. (11:10)\n You ain't getting no younger. (11:19)\n You're painting your hunger. (11:29)\n You're driving you home. (11:35)\n Freedom, freedom. (11:43)\n Well, that's just some people talking. (11:50)\n Prison is walking through this world all alone. (12:01)\n Don't your feet get cold in the wintertime? (12:18)\n As though I won't fall when the sun won't shine. (12:25)\n It's hard to tell the night time from the day. (12:33)\n Losing all your hands alone. (13:03)\n And I'm wondering how the feeling goes away. (13:23)\n Oh, Desperado. (13:40)\n Why don't you come to your senses? (13:47)\n And down from your fetters. (13:57)\n Open the gates. (14:06)\n It may be raining, but there's a rainbow above you. (14:14)\n Let somebody love you. (14:32)\n Before it's too, oh, really bitter. (14:38)\n Let somebody love you. (14:48)\n Before it's too late. (15:00)\n Desperado. (15:30)\n Why don't you come to your senses? (15:54)\n It's been how bright and fancy. (16:01)\n For so long, for so long now. (16:10)\n Oh, you're a hard one. (16:20)\n How the hell you got your reason? (16:27)\n These things that are pleasing you. (16:38)\n You can hate you somehow. (16:48)\n Don't you draw the queen of clemency. (17:06)\n She'll beat you if she's able. (17:15)\n But of the queen of hearts, you'll wait your best man. (17:22)\n Now it seems to me, (17:41)\n that all your highs and lows have been laid apart. (17:45)\n With all those troubles and troubles, and you're only one. (17:51)\n One you can't give. (17:59)\n Desperado, it's coming. (18:13)\n Oh, you wanna get a little younger. (18:18)\n Your pain and your hunger. (18:29)\n They're driving you insane. (18:37)\n And freedom, oh, freedom. (18:44)\n Oh, well, that's just some people talking. (18:52)\n The prison is walking through this. (19:03)\n Oh, oh, no. (19:15)\n Don't you feel yet cold in the wintertime? (19:23)\n Oh, it's cold snow and the sun won't shine. (19:32)\n It's hard to tell. (19:39)\n And I die from the day. (19:44)\n You're losing all your eyes. (19:59)\n And you're feeling funny. (20:06)\n Because freedom goes away. (20:10)\n Oh, goes away. (20:16)\n Despair, the rebel. (20:24)\n Open the gates. (20:54)\n Maybe it'll rain. (21:00)\n A rainbow above you. (21:14)\n And let it let down, but it'll love you. (21:22)\n Before it's too late.

        "transcript": " So I don't always look at things people comment or whatever but someone asked what got me interested in piano and I thought I'm sure I've mentioned something with that before and eventually I want that sort of question to be self-answerable. (0:00)\n Alright, but I've always loved music and I thought it would be a good activity for one of my kids to pick up so I started doing it. (0:23)\n But I kept doing it probably because I'm investigating, well I mean I'm investigating a variety of things. I'm just curious about the patterns you can discover in learning. (0:41)\n And I think we should try and understand human learning as well as machine learning. I mean people are interested in that because it's controllable. (1:05)\n But working in congruence with one another, it is probably the optimal solution to a lot of things. (1:28)\n So piano is definitely a good mind activity. (8:10)\n And the primary thing I wanted to do was collect data so I could understand the learning process. I mean that was the initial reason that I started to record this.

(1:12)\n If you want to study learning. (1:24)\n There's not enough data for language-related learning, but just the musical learning. (1:30)\n I don't know if I'll ever get to the point where it will be useful as a linguistic data set. (1:43)\n Probably most of the audio quality would prevent that up to this point.

(0:08)\n I was playing this because I was thinking about what I was working on. I was listening (0:13)\n to this because I mean if I'm working on something on the front end I just listen to whatever (0:30)\n the recent iteration is. I don't know if you can call it music, but um, and so, um, I was (0:37)\n working on a couple of different things. I think I was not bad. I'm probably just going (0:51)\n to get that. I was working on tagging words. Words are hard. What are words? What? What (1:05)\n have we defined as a word in our language or choice? Whatever it is. And what, what causes (1:18)\n an iteration to increase or an addition of a word or a concept? I mean, the dictionary (1:32)\n is, it's a useful tool, but it shouldn't be our guiding light, I guess I would say, because (1:45)\n the world changes and it pays much faster than we change our language and some smaller (1:55)\n language groupings tend to exist depending on the process and the thing that you're trying (2:09)\n to achieve. I mean, understanding all of those smaller iterations, I mean, the first type of (2:20)\n iteration is like a language, English or German or Japanese, those are the three I speak, but (2:29)\n German not so well anymore. But um, yeah, that's the first breakdown and then you have these (2:39)\n smaller groupings of people which in the generative and acular. I mean, everybody who (2:50)\n is associated with a company that's not necessarily a company that can be a group that study together (2:57)\n and groups that work together and live together and just share together. So that are an acular that you (3:04)\n create. It can be interesting, I'm not sure all the implications that I have, but hey, (3:15)\n ah, (4:16)\n We're certainly (4:22)\n toil (4:25)\n oh (4:36)\n No (4:41)\n I (5:01)\n As to my leaders. (6:30)\n conducting english (7:09)\n I'm just gonna go up and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and (7:35)\n and and water. (8:05)\n My audio memory is significantly better than my visual memory. (8:35)\n I'm not sure why. (8:49)\n I think my visual... it's almost like two different operations. (8:57)\n I mean, if you think of it in computer terms. (9:08)\n So the visual input feeds into a substructure, a linguistic substructure in the mind, (9:12)\n I think, and that's probably why my visual... I mean, I call it input because I'm thinking (9:27)\n about computers and how we can... I mean, a lot of the times I'm thinking about how we can (9:36)\n use computers to better our cell, I'm sorry. (9:43)\n I don't know if that's why I've been watching tennis... (9:47)\n tennis a lot and the pianos is a betterment of the cell. (9:57)\n And that really should be one of the ultimate goals of utilizing a computer. (10:04)\n I was just thinking of myself, the silence, the sounds, the sounds. (10:17)\n I suspect some of the better videos as far as audio content are the ones that come (10:26)\n after the longest pause is just quite interesting. (10:40)\n That's probably why we write things down because that's a much quicker input mechanism. (10:48)\n I mean, you can't... (10:59)\n I mean, that's our linguistic visual structure. (11:04)\n And so you have that subsystem I guess I would say, your linguistic understanding (11:10)\n of the prior set of actions. (11:22)\n I mean, that's what all these tools are doing, essentially taking in prior set of actions (11:28)\n and generating the extraction, which is a lot like piano improvisation. (11:38)\n I'm not sure what, if any of that will actually reach anybody of that. (11:44)\n I'm trying to be more eloquent. (12:01)\n I don't know what that was, I'm just sitting around. (12:07)\n i (12:31)\n O circumcised bow, standing up the wide sea of myths opened to my life. (13:01)\n The (13:12)\n side of my dear ways, (13:14)\n how are you Greek? (13:18)\n ooter (13:23)\n I'll accompany you, the fine夠! (13:48)\n Like the blood of, ah var 추 the sangre w深 (13:57)\n Oh you know I want that woman right here (14:07)\n I felt so good, I felt so wonderful. (14:32)\n Why did not you listen. (14:43)\n You were a unnecessary person. (14:50)\n Will I ever do that? (16:21)\n I want to be there. (16:25)\n Will I ever do that? (16:29)\n So I'm trying to create something. (16:33)\n I mean, what it is yet meaning what the eventual use cases of it may end up being if it (16:49)\n already can see the size of it, I mean, the most common, no.

(17:16)\n I'm not sure if that is true about the entry after pause. (17:23)\n I'm curious what it might end up being. (18:34)\n I wonder if a different metric might point to intriguing information.

(0:08)\n I was playing this because I was thinking about what I was working on. I was listening (0:13)\n to this because I mean if I'm working on something on the front end I just listen to whatever (0:30)\n the recent iteration is. I don't know if you can call it music, but um, and so, um, I was (0:37)\n working on a couple of different things. I think I was not bad. I'm probably just going (0:51)\n to get that. I was working on tagging words. Words are hard. What are words? What? What (1:05)\n have we defined as a word in our language or choice? Whatever it is. And what, what causes (1:18)\n an iteration to increase or an addition of a word or a concept? I mean, the dictionary (1:32)\n is, it's a useful tool, but it shouldn't be our guiding light, I guess I would say, because (1:45)\n the world changes and it pays much faster than we change our language and some smaller (1:55)\n language groupings tend to exist depending on the process and the thing that you're trying (2:09)\n to achieve. I mean, understanding all of those smaller iterations, I mean, the first type of (2:20)\n iteration is like a language, English or German or Japanese, those are the three I speak, but (2:29)\n German not so well anymore. But um, yeah, that's the first breakdown and then you have these (2:39)\n smaller groupings of people which in the generative and acular.

(7:19)\n I'm so... (7:21)\n I'm close to you (7:33)\n I'm so close to you (7:37)\n What? (8:09)\n out (8:15)\n My audio memory is significantly better than my visual memory.

(0:42)\n I found it through the tennis source that I thought was quite intriguing. (0:46)\n I don't want to use it without detecting the ball. (0:56)\n So all the work that had to go into that is quite impressive. (1:02)\n Just to do some things too good like that. (1:09)\n To detect the ball. (1:14)\n Sport analytics is a very intriguing use case for data analytics in general. (1:18)\n And learning how to utilize the library and things like that. (1:32)\n I think that's... (1:43)\n That's part of what I'm trying to do. (1:48)\n I don't know that it's amazing. (1:53)\n But it's a very good use case for learning these algorithms that are going to become a part of everyday life. (1:57)\n But just like anything else in life, I mean the depths of understanding of what the computer is actually doing is quite varied in the population. (2:13)\n Just like reading ability is quite varied. (2:37)\n And there are a lot of things to determine that. (2:44)\n But this is something that I think we should strive to have some literacy about.

(0:09)\n The language of control. (0:14)\n Which I need to make more variable, I think. (0:18)\n I think we're going to end up with less syntax languages eventually. (0:29)\n I think we can make a little bit more shared grammar between them. (0:41)\n I looked nearly as if it has a grammatical syntax, (0:48)\n and that gets compiled into a small JavaScript file. (0:56)\n I think that's a good way, but I need it. (1:05)\n It doesn't have any of the lexical information about the computer languages. (1:09)\n So that's kind of annoying. (1:17)\n And that's always things need to be parsed or if that's the old library. (1:24)\n A couple other libraries, but I don't like any of them. (1:34)\n I don't know if that's the right time. (1:39)\n There was a teaching library. (6:18)\n So I don't remember the teaching. (6:26)\n I don't remember the teaching. (6:32)\n There was a teaching library. (6:39)\n I don't remember the teaching. (6:48)\n Yeah, that should be a standard thing for all the drivers. (6:54)\n They should be packaged and made them to be used in the browser.
