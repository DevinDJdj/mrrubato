<!--
Make new file with parameters:
?direction=in/out/both
?num=12
?depth=1 -> follow topics within one step of specified topic.  Do same logic and add to provenance chain.  
This will probably be far too large.  Step 
visnetwork
vis.DataSet([
        {
      id: 1,
      label: "1",
      level: 1
    },
])
--level: 1, 2, 3
?topics=one,two
Allow for multiple topics.  

Pseudo-code:
Parse parameters.
read book.  
generate provenance chart for selected topic.  
TOPIC - 12
Higher weight for closer to target topic.  

This should be nice.  
Get git commits for topics in question if exist.  
And display bottom or right panel file as well as specific commits can be multiple when that provenance input is selected.  
Each provenance should have one or multiple dates related.  
Get commits for particular dates.  
Just use network, not sankey for this.  
Use DOT representation..
Basically level is inherent in the data.  

Parameter for provenance info (date, weight)
Only look for commits in certain date ranges?  
Too complex..

Query should look something like this.  
@tutor /start **web/public/netgraph.mjs **web/public/graph.html try to create an implementation of **web/public/graph.html
Should adjust workprompt as needed.  
Use temp file in workprompt.  
generate needed context in there.  
All subsequent queries will use that temporary topic.
