<!--
Detailed parsing of one file.  
For now use new page, maybe eventually just adjust components in book.html
use book.ne grammar to parse book.  
Otherwise use code parsing tool to get a meaningful graph of function calls.  
Should be communication between book and page.  

BOOK
parse all elements
visjs graph for TOPIC/TOPIC/reference relationships.  
style to display all comment, commands etc.  

CODE
visjs graph from AST.  
prominent display of other pages from import/include.  
if selected, selectionhistory should be updated in book.html
Same code display as book.  Use token from book.  
Page dependent on book.html, and should be child page.  

Need multi-tab communication.  
localStorage and/or BroadcastChannel
const channel = new BroadcastChannel('app-data');
channel.postMessage(data);
const channel = new BroadcastChannel('app-data');

channel.addEventListener ('message', (event) => {
 console.log(event.data);
});

Same for
Book -> analyze -> rec 


should be able to query particular page by using selectionhistory number for inquiry.
