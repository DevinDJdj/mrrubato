Would like to add an output which contains metadata.  
This would include a CSV of the frame number (time) and the location of the ball and players
and any actions such as bounce etc.  
This would be useful for training a further model.  
But I really like this project as it is cohesive and understandable code and a great useful and practical example.  
Seems it is too slow to be very practical though.  
In order to create input for this, need to first generate the data with tennis language.

#this looks a bit better.  
#too slow though at the moment.
