; Encapsulation of the compressor opcode

; A compressor is a dynamics processor that essentially applies waveshaping to an audio signal.
; In the case of a typical compressor, increasingly high dynamics will be increasingly attenuated thereby reducing the dynamic range of a signal.
; This can be useful in forcing a dynamically expressive signal to sit better within a mix of signals or for processing a final mix so that it functions better when listened to in an environment with background noise. 

; When reference is made to a soft knee, this is the part of the dynamic mapping function that separates the lower response region and the upper response region. 
; Below the 'knee' the dynamic tranformation is 1:1, i.e. no change. 

; Threshold	-	Lowest decibel level that will be allowed through. Can be used to remove low level noise from a signal. A setting of zero will defeat this feature.  
; Low Knee	-	Decibel point at which the 'soft knee' 
; High Knee	-	Decibel point at which the 'soft knee' terminates
; Attack	-	Attack time of the compressor
; Release	-	Release time of the compressor
; Ratio		-	Compression ratio of the upper compressor response region
; Lookahead	-	Essentially this is a delay that will be applied to the signal that will be compressed (the track signal will always be un-delayed).
;			This can be useful for making sure that the compressor responds appropriately to fast attacks (at the expense of some added latency by the delay).
;			This is an initialisation time parameter so making changes to it will interrupt the realtime audio stream
; Gain		-	A make-up gain control. Use this to compensate for loss of power caused by certain ocmpressor settings.
