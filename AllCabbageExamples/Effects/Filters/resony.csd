; Resony is an implementation of a stack of second-order bandpass filters whose centre frequencies are arithmetically 
; related. 
; The 'bandwidth' and 'scaling mode' parameters are as they are in the reson opcode. 

; CONTROLS
; --------
; 'Base Freq.' (base frequency) defines the centre frequency of the first filter. 

; 'Sep' (separation) normally defines the separation between the lowest and highest filter in the stack in octaves. 
; How this relates to what the actual frequencies of filters will be depends upon which separation mode has been selected. 
; This is explained below. Note that in this example the operation of 'ksep' has been modified slightly to allow the 
; opcode to be better controlled from the GUI. These modifications are clarified below. Separation can be defined in 
; octaves using the knob 'Sep.oct.' or in semitones using the 'Sep.semi.' knob.
; Making changes to 'Sep.Semi', either via the slider or the number box, will causes changes in the 'Sep.Oct' slider and 
; number box (but not vice versa).

; 'Separatation Mode' defines the the way additional reson filters are arranged according to the 'Sep' value'. In 
; 'oct.total' separation mode, the pitch interval between the base frequency and (base frequency + separation is divided 
; into equal intervals according to the number of filters that have been selected. Note that no filter is created at the 
; frequency of (base frequency + separation). For example: if separation=1 and num.filters=2, filters will be created at 
; the base frequency and a tritone above the base frequency (i.e. an interval of 1/2 and an octave). I suspect this is a 
; mistake in the opcode implementation so in this example I rescale the separation interval before passing it to the 
; resony opcode so that the interval between the lowest and highest filter in this mode will always be the interval 
; defined in the GUI. 
; If 'hertz' separation mode is selected behaviour is somewhat curious. I have made some other modifications to the 
; values passed to the opcode to make this mode more controllable. Without these modifications, if number of filters is 
; '1' no filters would be created. The frequency relationship between filters in the stack always follows the harmonic 
; series. Both 'Base Frequency' and 'Separation' normally shift this harmonic stack of filters up or down, for this reason 
; I have disabled user control of 'Separation' in this mode, instead a value equal to the 'Number of Filters' will always 
; be used for 'Separation'. This ensures that a harmonic stack will always be created built upon 'Base Frequency' as the 
; fundamental. Negative values for 'separation' are allowed whenever 'separation mode' is 'octaves' (if this is the case, 
; the stack of frequencies will extend below the base frequency). Negative values for 'separation' when 'separation mode' 
; is 'hertz' will cause filters to 'explode'. As 'Separation' is fixed at 'Number of Filters' in this example this 
; explosion will not occur.

; A third option I have provided allows the defined interval to be the interval between adjacent filters rather than the 
; interval from lowest to highest. In this mode it is probably wise to keep the separation value lowish, or reduce the 
; number of filters (or both), otherwise filters with very high frequencies might be being requested. This could potentially
; lead to some rather unpleasant distortion. In actuality there is some protection against this (discussed later on).

; 'B.width'	-	bandwidth of the filters (in hertz).

; 'Num.' (number of filters) defines the number of filters in the stack. 

; 'Scaling Mode'	-	provides options for scaling the amplitude of the filters. If 'none' is chosen output
; 				amplitude can increase greatly, particularly if bandwidth is narrow (a low value).
;				

; In addition a lowpass and highpass filter have been added after the resony filter
;
;         +--------+   +----------+   +---------+
; INPUT---+ RESONY +---+ HIGHPASS +---+ LOWPASS +---OUTPUT
;         +--------+   +----------+   +---------+
;
; The cutoff frequencies of each of these filters are defined as ratios relative to the base frequency. 
;
; Unpleasant sounds can result if reson filters are given too high cutoff frequencies. This can occur through a combination
; of the settings for 'BF' (base frequency), 'Num.' (number of filters), 'Sep.' (separation) and 'Separation Mode'. This 
; instrument features a safety measure whereby if this is going to happen the 'Num.' value will be reduced. If you notice
; the 'Num.' slider moving by itself while you are making adjustments to other controls this is the reason. This safety 
; mechanism is most likely to cut when 'Octs Adjacent' mode is selected.
