; An emulation of a Leslie rotating speaker as commonly used with a Hammond organ

; A Leslie speaker consists of two speaker drivers, a high frequency tweeter and a low frequency woofer, which rotate at on of two speed according to a switch.
;  (For clarification, the woofer itself does not actually spin, instead a baffle rotates around it.)

; The main interface is simply two main switches which switch between the slow and fast speeds, and a 'setup' button which accesses advanced controls.
; The default advanced settings represent typical characteristics for a real Leslie speaker.

; This .csd works as an effect upon the audio input, but it can also be tested by playing a basic built-in organ using a connected MIDI keyboard

; Setup
; -----
; The same set of parameters are provided for the woofer and the tweeter.

; Cutoff	-	the cutoff frequency of the crossover (lowpass for the woofer, highpass for the tweeter)
; Damping	-	change from one speed to the other is not instantaneous.
;				'Damping' defines the amount of mechanical resistance to changing speed.
;				Typically the woofer takes longer to change speed (higher damping).
; RPM Slow	-	speed (in revolutions per minute) when speed is 'Slow'
; RPM Fast	-	speed (in revolutions per minute) when speed is 'Fast'
; Doppler	-	amount of doppler shift (pitch shift) during rotation
; Panning	-	width of panning modulation
; Amplitude	-	amount of amplitude modulation
