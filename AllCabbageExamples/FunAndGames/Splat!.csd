; Splat.csd
; Written by Iain McCurdy, 2014.
; 
; Left click somewhere within the swarm to splat the flies. 
; Left click again somewhere within the field of splatted flies to unsplat them and bring them back to life.
; 
; Population	-	the number of flies in the swarm
; Liveliness	-	the speed with which flies will move about within the swarm
; Excursion	-	how far flies will move away from the centre of the swarm, therefore this also defines the area covered by the swarm.
; Fly Size	-	doesn't affect the physical size of flies but instead affects the central frequency of the buzzing tone they produce.
; Swarm Speed	-	the speed with which the swarm moves around the panel. The swarm can exit the panel completely.
; 
; If the swarm area (excursion) is very small it can become difficult to splat (and unsplat) it. 
; If this becomes a problem, simply raise the value for excursion, even while the swarm is splatted.
