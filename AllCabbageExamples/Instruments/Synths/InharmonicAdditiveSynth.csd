; 
; This instrument takes information about modal frequency values for a sound (in the form of a list of values in a GEN 02 
; function table and transfers it into a GEN 09 function table for efficient playback by a single oscillator opcode.
; GEN 09 demands partial numbers to be integers (if we want ot avoid unwanted artefacts in the sound) so all modal 
; frequencies are multiplied by a large number before being rounded to integers  for the GEN 09 table in order to reduce 
; the loss of precision. There is a trade off in that we need this multiplier value to be large to minimise quantisation
; but if it is very large we need to use a higher quality oscillator opcode (more CPU drain) and/or a larger function table
; size for the GEN 09 tables (longer load time when the example is started).
; 
; If the size chosen for the GEN 09 tables is too small, aliasing artefacts will result when it is played back.
; 
; Amplitude Envelope
; ------------------
; Att.	-	Attack time in seconds
; Dec.	-	Decay time in seconds
; Sus.	-	Sustain level
; Rel.	-	Release time
; Level	-	Output amplitude level
; 
; Instrument
; ----------
; Select a GEN09 function table corresponding to a instrument or object
; 
; Filter Envelope (Lowpass)
; -------------------------
; Amount	-	Amount of influence of the envelope (in octaves)
; Dec.	-	Decay time in seconds
; Sus.	-	Sustain level
; Rel.	-	Release time in seconds
; Offset	-	Filter offset value (in octaves)
; 
; Chorus
; ------
; Mix	-	Dry/Wet mix of the chorus effect
; Depth	-	Depth of the modulations of the chorus effect
; Rate	-	Rate of modulation
