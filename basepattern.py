# Example 5 - Generating Score
# Author: Steven Yi <stevenyi@gmail.com>

# Adapted for Python 3 by Fran√ßois Pinot, July 2021
#
# In this example, we will look at three techniques for generating our Score. 
# 
# The first is one we have already seen, which is to just write out the score
# by hand as a String.
#
# Knowing that we pass strings into Csound to pass note events, we can also
# generate the string.  In the second example, sco2 starts as an empty string.
# Using a for-loop, we append to sco2 note strings using a string formatting
# string that has its replacement values replaced.  The replace values are 
# calculated using the i value, and the result is an ascending note line. 
#


#how to save to midi?  not sure.  
#c.setMIDIOutput(midioutputdevicename/number)
#c.setMIDIFileOutput(testing.midi)
#https://csound.com/download
#https://git-scm.com/
#have to use CSCORE input for that I guess.  
#https://flossmanual.csound.com/midi/midi-output
#ok we have midi out, we have to adjust it to what it should be, it is the last 3 parameters.  
#have to calculate the key, and velocity
#0-127 range.  
#here is the frequency lookup https://www.inspiredacoustics.com/en/MIDI_note_numbers_and_center_frequencies
#so lets generate midi file at the same time.  
#then we can use the midi patterns and make some music.  
#check two patterns, make two tracks with midi, make sure it works.  
#can use the same instrument, but we distinguish tracks how exactly?  
#FrequencyToMidi, AmplitudeToMidi conversion functions

#circular pattern
circular = '''
how can we create a circular pattern?  
many individual scales which represent individual circles perhaps.  
maybe an individual circle represents a frequency for the start of the scale.  
So maybe all the scales are the same size.  and frequency is the speed.  
So the higher the frequency the larger the circle.  
What circles do we chose?  

Lets use several rotating circles on a sphere.  
what do the different circles on the sphere represent?  
What is a frequency that is rotated?  It adjusts the frequency.  
If we do that, we need to use the csound library to make an instrument.  
not the midi sequence.  
maybe different size freqencies travelling down the same path of rythm using the base rythm as some multiple of the freqency.  
Kind of like this concept.  
i.e. 55Hz represents 55*PI*2
and the rhythm pattern represents [1,2,1,2,1,2]
then we would have a rythm pattern for 55Hz being 55*PI*2*1 = currenttime
and next note starts 55*PI*2*2
The frequency becomes correlated with the duration.  
Kind of like we did with the fractal.  
But lets see how many different rythms we can combine.  We need a PRIMORIAL maybe to be the base pattern.  
So lets try 210 to start as our PRIMORIAL
So lets use just 55*2, 55*3, 55*5, 55*7.  
Or we can just combine all of these patterns into the one circle.  divide the same circle into 2, 3, 5, 7
Roll those down time, and when the spokes touch, we create sound, but what sound?  
What is the relationship between the spokes and frequency?  
Roll the circles inside of each other.  
When they meet, they make a sound of the frequencies related.  
i.e. 2 is rolling inside of 3, and 5, and 7.  
3 is rolling inside of 5 and 7
5 is rolling inside of 7.  
When they meet at a multiple there is additional sound.  
This essentially becomes a pattern of the factors of numbers.  
This is not really circular, but lets go with it.  
all numbers represent the points in time.  
For now lets just use unique factors.  Exponent just increases the amplitude of that note.  

Now use a circle with radius 2 and run it down the number line.  
Then a circle with radius 3 and do the same.  
And only make a sound when it comes into contact with a whole number.  
Also make the sound of the circle radius perhaps?  or combine it with the number itself.  
The radius number should be the loudest and the actual number (chorrd) a different volume.  
And then make the sound of what that number represents.  
So what sound does a number represent?  
Using primes is ok I think.  
Multiple circles going down the number line.  
If they overlap we have a sound which correlates to the relationship between whichever two are overlapping.  
What is that frequency?  
If they are close to a number, we create a sound based on that frequency.

#do we keep adding or some other way?

#What rhythm patterns to combine?  
#factor each number in the individual pascal row, and use the factors as the beat pattern for that 1 beat.  
#is just going up the triangle sequentially best?  
#do we also use the internal factors to create extra beat patterns like below?  
#do we make more familiar beat blocks of 4, 8, 12, 16 or not by combining (INTERNAL PATTERN)

#I think just use the pattern for the factors.  i.e. 1, 5, 10 (2, 5), 20 (2, 2, 5), 10 (2, 5), 5, 1
#not sure exactly how to do this, but divide evenly into the number of factors that we have.  
#do the pattern starting with separate notes.  
#if we have the same number twice or 3 times, we start at different octaves.  
#i.e. 20 will have 3 notes, 2 with pattern 2, and 1 with pattern 5.  
#if we have multiple factors we can use different tracks/instruments.  
#for now the track will equal the factor#, like if there are 3 factors, we have track 1, 2, 3 for those three factors.  
#start at same octave and go up/down if there are multiple.  
#then just for now sequentially use the factors as the rhythm.  Leave one beat space at the end to understand the pattern.  
#lets try also with one note per factor.  I think this will be better.  

#but what notes?  
#lets try an arpeggiation of some kind with the rhythm.  
#lets make it random arpeggiation of some kind (skip or not skip next step in arpeggiation is random).  
#up or down is random based on what frequency we are at.  
#what is the key though?  
#where do we start?  
#track will equal to the rhythm pattern.  
#lets just do a simple chord progression.  
#Use the middle of the pascal triangle to find the key, then work out from there.  
#1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 20, 35
#*2, *2/3, *6/3, *6/10, *20/10, *20/35, *70/35, etc.  
#I think this should be fine for initial starting range.  
#what is our frequency range?  lets say 220 to 220*16.  
#same way we go up or down based on the factor.  What do we do when we go out of range, just correct direction?  For now this is fine.  
#2 pattern is Base, Base*2 or Base/2
#3 pattern is Base, Base*3/2 *2/3
#5 pattern lets do Base, Base*5/4 *5/4, *4/5 *4/5?  
#7 pattern as well, Base, Base*7/6 *7/6 *7/6, *6/7 * 6/7 * 6/7.  



#how do we adjust amplitude?  each number has an amplitude adjustment.  
#row increases in amplitude and decreases back after the middle.  
#runs all decrease amplitude going up, and increase coming back down.  
#simple amplitude pattern.

#NUMBER LINE 
numberline = '''
Each number represents the wavelength of the sound starting with 1.  
Wavelength of 1 will be middling (880Hz?), as this will be near the most played notes.  
Each multiple of 2 will switch to below or above the 880Hz.  
Every other number will have the pitch adjusted in some way.  
Each number only plays the sound of the Factors.  
With more factors, the amplitude is decreased for each note.  
Less factors, the amplitude is increased, and the length of note is increased, or repeated around the average number of factors.  
Rhythm is included based on the average number of factors for any number at that point.  
What rhythm we can make somewhat random, or based on the lowest prime numbers which were included in that set of notes.  
Have the set include the lowest prime number LATEST ENTRIES.  
Within that set you will have a lowest prime number and that is your next number of LATEST ENTRIES
Within that set, we generate rhythm based on all the prime factors which exist.  
Rhythm is just a tuplet of the lowest prime number for now.  
This should be expanded in some interesting fashion, but no good ideas yet.  
Which notes are included, use the lowest prime number as the base Hz, so for instance 880/5 = 176
Then all numbers above that lowest prime are calculated from this, and of course use 2 to decrease the frequency to an audible range.  
Not sure if we should use rhythm to represent the number of notes etc.  
We could use all of the frequencies of the prime numbers or the most used prime numbers as kind of a background beat.  
Tempo is slowed based on the number of factors as that increases.  

Dont worry about 2 switching, just divide by the highest multiple of 2, i.e. /8 or /16 etc.  
If we do this, perhaps we dont need the logic stated above.  
This is also easier to calculate.  
But higher numbers will get some large octave jumps.  
If it is inaudible, just leave it for now.  
All other factors divided by the 2^n.  
Amplitude increased for how many factors.  
i.e. 7, 8, 9 only use 3 items because 3 is the lowest factor.  
 = 3,3,7, so 3/8 Amplitude*2*amplitudefactor?  and 7/8
This will switch the octaves based on the notes anyway.  
8, 9, 10 = 3, 3, 5 so again 3/8 Amplitude*2*amplitudefactor and 5/8
9,10,11 = 3,3,11 and this is 3/2 Amplitude*2*amplitudefactor and 5/2 and 11/2
10,11,12 this will always be 3 numbers.  Just the factors and rhythm change.  
= 3,5,11  /4 
How could we increase the number of elements?  
Or do we want to?  
Many numbers will be inaudible.  Maybe start a bit lower.  440Hz?  

Frequency is fine, but I think rhythm needs to be something else than just the tuplets.  
Or do something the same like inlcude all fo the factor numbers, like include 3, 5, 11 again underneath.  
So 5 would be 5/4 and 3/4
3 would be 3/2
11 is 3/2, 5/2, 11/2
only do up to 3.  
SO all rhythms and notes of these will be included.  
Also do we continue the recursion?  I think so.  Basically we adjust the tempo for however many recursions occurred, or however many unique factors there are.  
This ends up just being octaves, but it will not always be the case.  

Dont take the lowest prime, take the lowest prime of the current number.  
So all primes will include all numbers up to that point which becomes all primes up to that point / largest 2^n.  
Go up to 210 perhaps.  
Maybe rhythm only used from the lowest prime number of elements.  
But harmony used from all?  No that's too busy.  Maybe just do the 3 elements.  And maybe recurse.  
This will work better musically.  Mathematically not so nice.  
What can we do other than tuplets for rhythm?  
Emphasize more the closer it is to the actual number we are on, or if it is a factor of the number we are on.  
Amplitude calculation here.  
If it is a factor of the number do the tuplet of the opposite from the largest prime.  i.e. 12 = 3/4, 6/4, 9/4, 12/4
10 = 5/2, 10/2
28 = 7/4, 14/4, 21/4, 28/4
56 = 7/8, 14/8, etc.  
All these overtones of the highest prime number.  
Or only pick some of these overtones based on the other primes which we have.  
Play these notes over and over in a tuplet of the prime?  
And then pick these notes of any other factors which exist.  
i.e. 60 = 5/4, 10/4, 15/4, 20/4, etc.  
and then pick each third.  15/4, 30/4 etc.  



Maybe this will make for more interesting harmony.  
Do the opposite for others which are not the number going down.  Maybe this will bring out some distinction.  

Primes are just one single note with all primes up to that point?  Or some of the primes up to that point 1/ln(p) perhaps.  
Every prime has this chance of being selected.  Primes will only have a chord.  


Further Details to be determined.
