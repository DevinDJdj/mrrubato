#https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm?tab=readme-ov-file

browserify main.js -o bundle.js


**server/ollama/custom.py
Lets see if we can make a custom model here instead of langchain RAG.  
**server/ollama/custom.parameter

#https://llm.mlc.ai/docs/deploy/webllm.html
create custom model for this.  
Eventually.

**web/public/languageeditor.html
Does this component work well with multiple existing languages?  
Also create a font and test with this.  

**web/public/testfont.html
Need to be able to create font entries for each concept/word.  
Font size is going to need to be somewhat larger.  
This is an important question/constraint.  
How large do we want the font size?  
Lets try 32 for now.  ~400x400 area


**web/public/rec.html
Need to save video.  
#https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/web/start#web_1

**web/public/storage_upload.html
Does this work for full recording?  

**web/public/keymap.js
Need commands for controlling scrolling of standard screen components.  
i.e. Select chat row for reading.  select transcript, source code or change


So a parameter for building context.  
Importance on Time of the current video.  
Importance of Book content.  
Importance of Git changes.  
Importance of TOPIC similarity.  
Importance of Selected TOPIC.  
Others?
All of these parameters will adjust the context which is built.  


**web/public/languages.js
findWordsA needs to be adjusted when set octave is used.  
Right now if we adjust octave I think the words are getting saved, but UI not updated.  


**web/public/testvisjs.html
--ok

**web/public/analyze.html
Maybe switch pianoroll UI to this?  
May be easier.  
Dont actually need full 3d library.  

**web/public/book.html
use vidinfo a bit more.  


**timestep.py
Add the copy of git contents.  
DB Top-level 
/git/contents
/git/commits
Then same directory structure or hash entries.  

**git/clone.py
git log --since="last month" --pretty=format:'%H,%an,%as,%at,%s' > log.csv
Maybe this is enough for now?  
Store this in DB?  
If exists, skip.  
Otherwise download all changes etc.

**web/public/git.js
Need to make the git download asynchronous.  
gitDownloadCommits -> gitChartCommits

visjs need to not create duplicate entries.  
Make group per file like other chart.  
make mouseover tooltip with change contents just for that file?

Just create a training dataset which takes the BOOK as input and the next commit in the same file as answers?  

**web/public/book.html
Should also pass transcript of video to the llm.  
Sometimes the response is interesting but most of the time it is garbage.  
Very strange.  
"stopllm" not working.  
Why so annoying to utilize modules in JS.  

GIT API testing is annoying.  
Even with the token, still too many requests.  
Need to download.  

**git/clone.py
store in DB, and retrieve from DB.  
Not content, but all relational info and commit info.  

**web/public/test/web-llm/test.js

  const config = {
    temperature: 0.5,
    top_p: 1,
    sliding_window_size: 1024,  //do we have to use this as 1024 or 2048?  
    context_window_size: -1,
    attention_sink_size: 4, 
    repetition_penalty: 1.0
//    max_new_tokens: 300
//    max_tokens: 300
  };

    const completion = await engine.chat.completions.create({
      stream: true,
      messages,
      max_tokens: 512,
      stream_options: { include_usage: true },
    });


With these params though, seems to be much better results.  


**web/public/book.html
Need setting for number of previous "selectionhistory" to use in context passed to LLM.  
Balance "selectionhistory" files / changes?  
along with "gitbook".  
For now not enough to find related changes, maybe just get changes from same git push.  

This is a very important dynamic function.  
Almost should try to read the user intention and then input data.  
Whoever can figure out this trick of reading user intention...

**web/public/git.js
"selectionhistory", "gitbook"


**web/public/book.html
Probably need to remove the SVG visualization.  
It doesnt bring much really.  
Lets just put these book entries in the timeline instead of what we have now.  
**web/public/timewindow.js
"updateTimelineBook"
--test this.  

**git/clone.py
for now just do book.  
That is the primary thing being loaded anyway.  
https://api.github.com/repos/DevinDJdj/mrrubato

already some code here:
**timeste.py
"getCodeHistory"


**web/public/git.js
--test "loadGitBook"
--OK

Still need tooltip for book entries so we can read like a timeline for that topic.  
Make groups?  
Dont like this display yet.  

UI freezing on LLM call.  
How to prevent this?  
#https://github.com/TensorSpeech/TensorFlowTTS
Can we use these models in browser?  

#https://github.com/playerony/TensorFlowTTS-ts
Can we use in browser?  
**testing/Tensorflow
sudo apt install nodejs
npm install --global yarn

#https://github.com/MightyAlex200/tfjs-tts
git clone https://github.com/MightyAlex200/tfjs-tts.git

**web/public/test/tfjs-tts/index.html
Does this work?  
nice.  
So lets start using this.  
Why would we go to the server?  
Hmmm... Need a better GPU perhaps.  
Running the word2vec and the llm also on the GPU.  
At the moment dont expect any problems.  
How to make LLM asynchronous?  

Image of the old SETI distributed search.  
Current iteration, where each PC/Droid is linked to a master NN.  


**web/public/book.html
Add TTS to this.  
Optionally enable this instead of 
ssu = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(tospeak);
ssu = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(data.answer);

How to load different voice model?  

**web/public/test/tfjs-tts/index.js
const text2mel = tf.loadGraphModel('text2meljstiny/model.json');
const vocoder = tf.loadGraphModel('vocoderjstiny/model.json');

#https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-train-a-custom-model-in-ml5js/
#https://glitch.com/edit/#!/ml5-workshop2-1training?path=script.js%3A64%3A2

**web/public/test/ml5/index.html

Why not just train the voice model in the browser from the video or interaction?  
Option to train the voice model slowly but surely.  
Micro-training.  
Save/load model in user info.  

#https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflowjs-audio-codelab/index.html#8
Probably interesting to do this.  
We need something similar in this area.  


**web/public/test/ml5/load/index.html


**web/public/test/tfaudio/index.js
Use this perhaps for game.  
Training doesnt really work very well.  
Need a better probability indicator here
#https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflowjs-audio-codelab/index.html#8
      const predLabel = probs.argMax(1);
      await moveSlider(predLabel);

But positive is it is much more realtime than webaudio.  

**web/public/test/tfaudio/speechcommands/train.js
This seems to work ok.  
Can we use this on more than monosylable words?  
Often no detection?  


**web/public/book.html
Switch codemirror between languages.  

Anythin from "selectionhistory" which is not found, dont search again.  
--maybe fixed.  

**MISSINGTOPICS
store in DB under content and have a redirect.  


**web/public/midi.js
Need to make sure turn on/off speech and turn on/off midi is working.  
For now can only have one tab with active speech.  
Can we have multiple with the other recognition structure.  
**web/public/speech.js
 window.SpeechRecognition
vs 
**web/public/test/tfaudio/index.js
#https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/speech-commands
 recognizer = speechCommands.create('BROWSER_FFT');
 await recognizer.ensureModelLoaded();
   return navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
    audio: audioTrackConstraints == null ? true : audioTrackConstraints,
    video: false
  });
So we are using the mediaDevices.getUserMedia.  
Have more control using this for STT.  

Hmm... time, time time
Prefer to find a library with feedback training embedded in browser UI.  
Dont find one.  
Suppose this would be a good start but...

Why is there no feedback training loop within the library usage of these models?  
Especially for STT.  Just stupid design.  
Why is training separate from usage?  
#https://github.com/TensorSpeech/TensorFlowTTS
#https://github.com/TensorSpeech/TensorFlowASR


Suspect this works in multiple.  
Maybe work directly with audio.  


#https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechGrammar
This is basically the same thing.  
But This speechrecognition may not be active on the tab.  



What other possibilities.  
This will get better as part of browser eventually.  
But the personal trained model will be valuable.  
Maybe just make the files for training from videos.  


Need multi-tab communication.  
localStorage and/or BroadcastChannel
const channel = new BroadcastChannel('app-data');
channel.postMessage(data);
const channel = new BroadcastChannel('app-data');

channel.addEventListener ('message', (event) => {
 console.log(event.data);
});

This way we can investigate then start other actions.  
Use this to add to local storage window details.  

Book -> analyze -> rec 

**web/public/rec.html
Need to add topics to entries/times.  
Transcript should all go to gitbook?  

Use sequential topic entries as categorical structures.  
NGRAM structure instead of heirarchical.  
Potentially use separate functionality for sequential topics without content in between.  

**PARENT
**CHILD
Hierrarchical structure comment.  



**web/public/test/tfaudio/speechcommands/train.js
Better example now.  
Like this concept and design.  
But still a bug in here which is really annoying.  

#https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/blob/master/speech-commands/src/browser_fft_recognizer.ts
Line 330

    if (outputShape[1] !== this.words.length) {
      throw new Error(
          `Mismatch between the last dimension of model's output shape ` +
          `(${outputShape[1]}) and number of words ` +
          `(${this.words.length}).`);
    }

Can get around this by adding noise, but similar noise also creates a problem.  

Strange limitation to train on groups of 20 words.  
Might be useful though.  
We need something like this.  
To have a sound->string map.  
Is there no better library?  


#https://www.w3.org/TR/jsgf/

**web/public/speech.js
Probably want to make a custom one of these, or is this just for word lists?  
const recognition = new SpeechRecognition();
const speechRecognitionList = new SpeechGrammarList();
speechRecognitionList.addFromString(grammar, 1);
recognition.grammars = speechRecognitionList;

So switch grammar based on state.  
Hmmmm....
This is good for a game as well.  

#https://support.voicegain.ai/hc/en-us/articles/360048936511-JJSGF-Grammars

What are the grammar rules we are using for STT input?  
Maybe just define a JSGF for the command input as an alternative method.  
Maybe a JSGF generator for the speechKit would be useful.  
Audio -> JSGF phrase

Hmmm...
Definitely need to change the current handling.  

How do we map this in the most useful manner with the current technology available?  

**book
Probably should split up book by year now to make it more managable?  
Maybe not necessary for me. 


**web/public/book.html
Need to create a link to zoom/highlight something on the graphic.  
on loadTopic highlight this in the graphic.  

**web/public/word2vec-demo/scripts/main.js
Ugh finally some font size adjustment.  
svg, not loving the syntax.  

Adjust the display a bit more though, see if we can get something we like.  
Book entries need to be different color.  


**web/public/book.html
Eventually make sure this works with other repository.  
Should not have to pre-load source.  

Maybe the SVG will be nice.  
Need to adjust color perhaps based on some things, 

**web/public/timewindow.js
Dont need repeated entries here. 
If repeat within X time, ignore it.  
Base this on data density in the timewindow at the time.  

#https://visjs.github.io/vis-timeline/examples/timeline/groups/groupsEditable.html
Yeah that is more like what we want.  Combine with this.  
Can we make this dynamic?  For now just generate
<!--
  var groups = new vis.DataSet([
    {id: 0, content: 'First', value: 1},
    {id: 1, content: 'Third', value: 3},
    {id: 2, content: 'Second', value: 2}
  ]);
  var options = {
    // option groupOrder can be a property name or a sort function
    // the sort function must compare two groups and return a value
    //     > 0 when a > b
    //     < 0 when a < b
    //       0 when a == b
    groupOrder: function (a, b) {
      return a.value - b.value;
    },
    editable: true
  };
  var timeline = new vis.Timeline(container);
  timeline.setOptions(options);
  timeline.setGroups(groups);
  timeline.setItems(items);


timeline.getVisibleGroups()

.vis-item .vis-item-overflow {
  overflow: visible;
}

  var selection = document.getElementById('selection');
  var select = document.getElementById('select');
  var focus = document.getElementById('focus');
  select.onclick = function () {
    var ids = selection.value.split(',').map(function (value) {
      return value.trim();
    });
    timeline.setSelection(ids, {focus: focus.checked});
  };

  ID can be string.  
    groups.push({
      id: g,
      content: "Group " + g
    });
timeline.setGroups(groups);
-->

Need to dynamically size the topic window based on number of topics.  

--somewhat better.  

Probably change name to filename, and just keep the folder as group?  


**0606
Need to do one match in order to have sample data.  
Did we ever finish creating the language?  


**web/public/languages.js
Dont allow for duplicate entries in languages.  
--OK maybe.  

Do we need multiple instruments?  
This would be nice to add an instrument for the word.  
Where would we add this though?  
already have color in word.  Maybe this is enough.  
Based on this use different instrumentation.  Have color -> instrument mapping.  
Trigger word playback or adjust feedback midi directly to change instrument.  
The instrument map should be determined by listener.  

How to input this script?  This will be easy enough to load.  
Should we add parenthesis?  

add language tennis (-6,6)
--start here.  
analyze.html?video=mj4jpeBvD2o
change language (-6,6)
add word hit (6,6)
how do we have synonyms?  This would get overwritten
Could have something mimicing back and forth across net.  
add word backhand (6,1) 
add word forehand (6,3) 
add word slice (6,2)
add word topspin (6,4)
add word volley (6,8)
add word drop (6,10)
add word serve (10,11)

add word fault (10,9)
add word let (10,8)
add word out (5,5)
add word long (5,6)
add word net (5,4)
add word bounce (4,4)
add word applause (3,4)
add word noise (3,5)

add word score (2,2) (param = 3,4,5,6,7)
2,8 = minus point, 2,3 = plus point, 2,4 plus game, 2,5 plus set
2,9 = minus game, 2,10 minus set 



add word player one (9,8)
add word player two (9,10)
