**news.py
Yep:
#https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper

#https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm?tab=readme-ov-file

browserify main.js -o bundle.js


**server/ollama/custom.py
Lets see if we can make a custom model here instead of langchain RAG.  
**server/ollama/custom.parameter

#https://llm.mlc.ai/docs/deploy/webllm.html
create custom model for this.  
Eventually.

**web/public/languageeditor.html
Does this component work well with multiple existing languages?  
Also create a font and test with this.  

**web/public/testfont.html
Need to be able to create font entries for each concept/word.  
Font size is going to need to be somewhat larger.  
This is an important question/constraint.  
How large do we want the font size?  
Lets try 32 for now.  ~400x400 area


**web/public/rec.html
Need to save video.  
#https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/web/start#web_1

**web/public/storage_upload.html
Does this work for full recording?  

**web/public/keymap.js
Need commands for controlling scrolling of standard screen components.  
i.e. Select chat row for reading.  select transcript, source code or change


So a parameter for building context.  
Importance on Time of the current video.  
Importance of Book content.  
Importance of Git changes.  
Importance of TOPIC similarity.  
Importance of Selected TOPIC.  
Others?
All of these parameters will adjust the context which is built.  


**web/public/languages.js
findWordsA needs to be adjusted when set octave is used.  
Right now if we adjust octave I think the words are getting saved, but UI not updated.  


**web/public/testvisjs.html
--ok

**web/public/analyze.html
Maybe switch pianoroll UI to this?  
May be easier.  
Dont actually need full 3d library.  

**web/public/book.html
use vidinfo a bit more.  


**timestep.py
Add the copy of git contents.  
DB Top-level 
/git/contents
/git/commits
Then same directory structure or hash entries.  

**git/
git log --since="last month" --pretty=format:'%H,%an,%as,%at,%s' > log.csv
Maybe this is enough for now?  
Store this in DB?  
If exists, skip.  
Otherwise download all changes etc.
