**server/...

Do we want to set up as services?  
https://medium.com/codex/setup-a-python-script-as-a-service-through-systemctl-systemd-f0cc55a42267

**web/public/analyze.html
Need ability to fix the transcription ideally.  
but dont think I want to deal with that now, due to the way the process works.  
Not sure how important this is.  


**server/
Need to make servers more robust.  
Unexpected queries shouldnt cause problems.  

sudo systemctl start transcription.service
sudo systemctl start tts.service

**extensions/mrrubato/
when decreasing frame rate, how do we capture audio, just use speed up algorithm?  
No should use detect audio dB level of capture, and cut low dB, then speed up.  
Responding to other youtube videos should be easy.  
If active tab is youtube link or watch link, 
need function to respond or not, then if respond is active, should comment on that video via API.  
Just use text from recording and generate a link to the resulting recording.  


**language
create language "xxxxx" (xxx is spoken, continue with key definition)
select language "xxxxx" (spoken or keys)
create word "xxxx" (xxx is spoken, continue with key definition)
"xxxx" (usage of word is just like any other predefined meta)
first search meta language, then search used language.  
meta language only searched if 48, 49, 71, 72 utilized.  
These will be control keys.  
Otherwise pass to the selected language.  
For now this doesnt leave us much room, but enough.  
Unfortunately it will be hard to generate pleasing combinations.  

**extensions
ROLI: Top of Keys = control
bottom of keys = free


**web/public/analyze.html
Show topics/add topics.  
Make suggestion list of topics (some work needed), easy interface to just click add/remove.  

DB need top folder /topics
/topics/topicname/topicvalue/YYYYMMdd/videoid
relevance: 90%

author, name, other
for now.  
What data do we want here. mostly point back to videos.  Perhaps we want a date
Where we click on the topic will indicate the relevance for the video.  
Dont have multiple clicks for this.  
Feedback in some sort of color indication (or bar)

For now need to be admin to create topic or word definitions.  

**timestep.py 
pass all topics to **server/transcription


**petunia 
Need a second server (useyoutube=false), need to complete this.  
This will allow for more participation.  

**web/public/search.html
Search/Chat, and also with connected instances.  


**database.rules
test comments from other user.  


**languages/ or extensions/keydict
Need to have point function and basic attention markers BBOX, Oval, Arrow etc.  
start recording and pause recording may also need to pause the original screen simultaneously as well.  
Yes probably.  

ROLI hope it has good midi/API access.  

**web/public/analyze.html
Need color picker/icon picker for display of words.  
-put this in the datatable with words.  

Need user icon somewhere.  
-put this in the large pianoroll view.  

Need dropdown datatable filter for lang
-words datatable

Play by word or by user.  
What is constitutes a segment?  
Need pre/post buffer of X seconds.  

**TTS/TTS/bin/synthesize.py
Finally got something out of this 180k steps in training:
python3 ./TTS/TTS/bin/synthesize.py --text "I am determined to acquire language." --model_path "./TTS/recipes/ljspeech/tacotron2-DCA/run-April-19-2024_02+00AM-0000000/best_model.pth" --config_path "./TTS/recipes/ljspeech/tacotron2-DCA/run-April-19-2024_02+00AM-0000000/config.json"
