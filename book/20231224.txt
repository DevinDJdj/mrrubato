Need to finish this.  
Just have a simple scrolling chat with smart agent.  
Calling the ollama/server.py
And Some videos which are sources to the right.  
Snippets of the videos, and link to analyze.html


**web/public/analyze.html
Show the selected language and some common words.  
Show the switch language as well.  
All of this should just be simple piano fingering images.  
Also when something is played, have a scrolling translation?  
Or just show that it is a known word.  
Have a few listed and then a popup to show/search many more.  
We could have a language as well for each embedding?  

Get rid of the top duplicate voice input.  
Pull the transcript from the DB if it is there.
