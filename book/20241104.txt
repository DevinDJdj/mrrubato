Lets try this again.  

add language tennis (-6,6)
--start here.  
Hmmmm... not working great.  
Also feedback is multiplied by the number of languages.  
Why is this occurring.  

Dont like the requirement for EOW.  
But this worked ok.  
add word hit 66,66,60,60
Maybe dont require this if we are using the pedal.  
pedal
add word hit 66,66
pass waspedaldown.  Yes this is better.  
Leave both options, shouldnt require pedal.  


analyze.html?video=mj4jpeBvD2o
change language (-6,6)
add word hit (6,6)
how do we have synonyms?  This would get overwritten
Could have something mimicing back and forth across net.  
add word backhand (6,1) 
add word forehand (6,3) 
add word slice (6,2)
add word topspin (6,4)
add word volley (6,8)
add word drop (6,10)
add word serve (10,11)

add word fault (10,9)
add word let (10,8)
add word out (5,5)
add word long (5,6)
add word net (5,4)
add word bounce (4,4)
add word applause (3,4)
add word noise (3,5)

add word score (2,2) (param = 3,4,5,6,7)
2,8 = minus point, 2,3 = plus point, 2,4 plus game, 2,5 plus set
2,9 = minus game, 2,10 minus set 



add word player one (9,8)
add word player two (9,10)
9,8 = set player 1
9,10 = set player 2

2,3,9,8 = player 1 gets point

In general should structure from left to right.  
So in this case player can be a prefix or a postfix.  
Structure should contain an element of distance.  


**web/public/analyze.html
Why are we crashing after leaving this up for significant period of time.  
Must be setTimeout stuff.  

Should we have iterations of feedback?  
Not sure how useful this is?  
We could put it into a different track with same language and then load multiple.  
Not sure I want to add this level of complexity at this point, but may regret not doing it.  

How do we leave a quick location stamp?  
We had already mentioned 
Bottom octave = B<->T
Top octave = L<->R

No need to use 0 here.  should be 1 based perhaps.  
0,24=BR
0,12=BL
12,24=TR
12,12=TL

TL = Center
Usually would start at center, and then go down on left hand
0,12 -> 12,24 BL->TR
0,24 -> 12,12 BR->TL
0,12 -> 12,12 BL->TL
0,24 -> 12,24 BR->TR

Standard Progression
12,12 -> 7,12 -> upper octave play 7, 15 8, 18... -> Perhaps back to 10,12

This is assuming the grid control methodology.  

Alternative would use time and vector methodology.  
Angle and distance.  
Perhaps same.  

Bottom octave = angle
Top octave = distance (exponential?)
12,12 = C
0,12 = C
0, 24 = 1,0
0,18 = 1/2,0
1,24 = sqrt(3)/2, -1/2
2,24 = 1/2, -sqrt(3)/2
3,24 = 0, -1
6,24 = -1,0
9,24 = 0,1
12,24 = 1,0

This is advantageous as we can use octave relationship as well then.  

Boxes will be better with the 

How good is eye-tracking technology?  
Do we want to use this instead?  I dont think so.  

So box = two consecutive in this sequence.  
Can do in any sequence, but must be 2 upper and 2 lower octave.  
First upper->first lower pair.  
So something like this would be common box with BOX numbers.  
9,20,8,18 for example.  Pick middle-top right area.  
Bottom octave has smaller.  
Maybe we should switch octaves.  Nah, already linguistically logical this way.  
Just not sure how distinct the more common audio patterns will be.  
0,12 -> 12,24 BL->TR
0,24 -> 12,12 BR->TL
0,12 -> 12,12 BL->TL
0,24 -> 12,24 BR->TR

If we have need for further detail, need 3rd octave.  
This can drill down within the selected box.  
In this case need pedal down indicator probably.  
Eventually can have inference logic, but probably not to start.  



What is command to change Center location?  

Lang selection function/octave, I like this.  
Create a langselect language which only searches for language and gives feedback.  
Essentially a function which is called on that octave.  
Single octave languages?  We can just overlap and then all second octave will be ignored.  
For now just use 2 octave selection range, and overlap.  



**web/public/language.js
updateVidTimes
Need to set current caption from transcript to the video.  
Try overlay as well as separate html div.  

Use text here.  
**web/public/video.js
drawVideo

probably change notesarray to not calculate each time?
