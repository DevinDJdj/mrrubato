Lets try this again.

--start here.  
Hmmmm... not working great.  
Also feedback is multiplied by the number of languages.  
Why is this occurring.  

Dont like the requirement for EOW.  
But this worked ok.  
add word hit 66,66,60,60
Maybe dont require this if we are using the pedal.  
pedal
add word hit 66,66
pass waspedaldown.  Yes this is better.  
Leave both options, shouldnt require pedal.

change language (-6,6)
add word hit (6,6)
how do we have synonyms?  This would get overwritten
Could have something mimicing back and forth across net.  
add word backhand (6,1) 
add word forehand (6,3) 
add word slice (6,2)
add word topspin (6,4)
add word volley (6,8)
add word drop (6,10)
add word serve (10,11)

add word fault (10,9)
add word let (10,8)
add word out (5,5)
add word long (5,6)
add word net (5,4)
add word bounce (4,4)
add word applause (3,4)
add word noise (3,5)

add word score (2,2) (param = 3,4,5,6,7)
2,8 = minus point, 2,3 = plus point, 2,4 plus game, 2,5 plus set
2,9 = minus game, 2,10 minus set 



add word player one (9,8)
add word player two (9,10)
9,8 = set player 1
9,10 = set player 2

2,3,9,8 = player 1 gets point

In general should structure from left to right.  
So in this case player can be a prefix or a postfix.  
Structure should contain an element of distance.  


**web/public/analyze.html
Why are we crashing after leaving this up for significant period of time.  
Must be setTimeout stuff.  

Should we have iterations of feedback?  
Not sure how useful this is?  
We could put it into a different track with same language and then load multiple.  
Not sure I want to add this level of complexity at this point, but may regret not doing it.  

How do we leave a quick location stamp?  
We had already mentioned 
Bottom octave = B<->T
Top octave = L<->R

No need to use 0 here.  should be 1 based perhaps.  
0,24=BR
0,12=BL
12,24=TR
12,12=TL

TL = Center
Usually would start at center, and then go down on left hand
0,12 -> 12,24 BL->TR
0,24 -> 12,12 BR->TL
0,12 -> 12,12 BL->TL
0,24 -> 12,24 BR->TR

Standard Progression
12,12 -> 7,12 -> upper octave play 7, 15 8, 18... -> Perhaps back to 10,12

This is assuming the grid control methodology.  

Alternative would use time and vector methodology.  
Angle and distance.  
Perhaps same.  

Bottom octave = angle
Top octave = distance (exponential?)
12,12 = C
0,12 = C
0, 24 = 1,0
0,18 = 1/2,0
1,24 = sqrt(3)/2, -1/2
2,24 = 1/2, -sqrt(3)/2
3,24 = 0, -1
6,24 = -1,0
9,24 = 0,1
12,24 = 1,0

This is advantageous as we can use octave relationship as well then.  

Boxes will be better with the 

How good is eye-tracking technology?  
Do we want to use this instead?  I dont think so.  

So box = two consecutive in this sequence.  
Can do in any sequence, but must be 2 upper and 2 lower octave.  
First upper->first lower pair.  
So something like this would be common box with BOX numbers.  
9,20,8,18 for example.  Pick middle-top right area.  
Bottom octave has smaller.  
Maybe we should switch octaves.  Nah, already linguistically logical this way.  
Just not sure how distinct the more common audio patterns will be.  
0,12 -> 12,24 BL->TR
0,24 -> 12,12 BR->TL
0,12 -> 12,12 BL->TL
0,24 -> 12,24 BR->TR

If we have need for further detail, need 3rd octave.  
This can drill down within the selected box.  
In this case need pedal down indicator probably.  
Eventually can have inference logic, but probably not to start.  



What is command to change Center location?  

Lang selection function/octave, I like this.  
Create a langselect language which only searches for language and gives feedback.  
Essentially a function which is called on that octave.  
Single octave languages?  We can just overlap and then all second octave will be ignored.  
For now just use 2 octave selection range, and overlap.

probably change notesarray to not calculate each time?  


Should we have more integration with the git repository?  
Maybe lets get the last few commits based on the time of the video, 
or have the option at least
this user
This could be based on the filter of user selection as well.  

We need some sort of word symetry around the re-ordered sets.  
i.e. ABCD is a set.  
All patterns
ACBD, ACDB etc should have some sort of symetry in meaning.  
This way we can eventually do multi at same time.  
Can have certain languages that only have SETs and no synchronicity in words.  
Yes need to distinguish this.  
As we learn to distinguish the sounds this will be useful.  
Can we have a sort of geometric similarity which will also be represented in the key structures?  


**descartes.js
Create mapping system.  
Need 2d and 3d.  
Use rotational system.  
Bottom octave can include nuance.  
2d = one
3d = two

i.e.
AB = 0-30 interval
balance based on key velocity
xy rotation.  

second interval is 3rd dimension.  
Same way, balance based on velocity. 
Only if we use two sequential keys.  

Use multiple dimensions and 
transcribe this into the word2vec coordinates.  
too many dimensions for this.  
How do we reduce this and still have it be meaningful?  

Is each dimension meaningful on its own?  
In this case we can have multiple maps and just use the dimensions which are meaningful.  
Or perhaps recreate a more useful mapping?  


https://medium.com/@enozeren/word2vec-from-scratch-with-python-1bba88d9f221


How many dimensions are we dealing with for word2vec?  
50-300
Just use as a test.  
This is far too many dimensions, this is probably due to the fashion in which 
it is generated.  
https://aclanthology.org/I17-2006.pdf

The dimensions themselves appear to be arbitrary and hold no purposeful meaning.  
Surely they hold meaning.  
Surely we should divide this into part-of-speech segments?

Spanish is the last classical language I will learn.  
This does not communicate the thought.  How can I expand on this to communicate the thought.  
Humans will acquire language at some point in real-time.  
Then all spoken language learned up to this point will be considered classical language.  
And all language past that point in time should be given a new name.  
I believe this point in time will be within the century if we live that long.  

I am not too concerned about the speed at which I acquire Spanish constructs.  
Other than the implications it has about my relationship with time.

<!--
Music covers larger freq range and sound level.  

Threshold of hearing
For freq in mid-upper, dB much lower.  

Auditory discrimination
Weber fraction
The three basic
auditory sensations are loudness, pitch, and perceived duration. These sensations are highly correlated with the
physical properties of sound intensity, sound frequency, and sound duration, respectively, but they are affected by
the other two physical properties of sound as well

intensity DL
frequency DL

The DL for sound intensity is typically about 0.5 to 1.0 dB within a wide range of intensities (greater than 20
dB above the threshold) and across many types of stimuli (Chochole and Krutel, 1968; Letowski and Rakowski,
1971; Riesz, 1928)
reaches up to about 3 dB for natural sounds listened to in natural
environment

We should use 24-key octaves in the middle of the piano.  
Discretization is a good thing or not.  Depends on the message.  


DL for frequency (in Hz) is relatively independent of
frequency and increases logarithmically with frequency at mid and high frequencies. T
the frequency DL is dependent on the frequency and intensity of the stimuli being
compared. It also depends on the duration and complexity of the stimuli. For tonal stimuli with intensity
exceeding 30 dB SPL, average frequency DLs are about 1 to 2 Hz for frequencies below 500 Hz and 0.1 to 0.4%
The cent is a logarithmic unit of measure used for musical intervals, often implemented in electronic tuners. Cents are used
to measure extremely small intervals or to compare the sizes of comparable intervals in different tuning systems.
Auditory Perception and Cognitive Performance 405
for frequencies above 1000 Hz (Koestner and Schenfeld, 1946; König, 1957; Letowski, 1982; Shower and
Biddulph, 1931).4
 All these values are typical for average sound intensity levels, and they are the same or slightly
smaller for increases in sound intensity up to about 80 dB SL (Wier, Jesteadt and Green, 1977). S

frequency DLs for narrow band noises centered at 800 Hz
vary from approximately 3 to 4 Hz for very narrow noises (Δf < 12 Hz) to more than 6 Hz for a noise band that is
64 Hz


####Temporal discrimination####

It refers to the human
ability to distinguish between acoustic stimuli or silent intervals of different length, to detect a silent gap in an
otherwise continuous stimulus, to resolve between one or two clicks presented in a succession, and to identify

4
 At low frequencies, the DL is constant in Hz; at mid and high frequencies, it is constant in percent (%).
406 Chapter 11
temporal difference and order in the onsets of two overlapping stimuli. The corresponding temporal
discrimination measures are called sound duration DL, gap detection threshold, temporal resolution, and
temporal order discrimination, respectively. 

A different type of auditory temporal resolution can be assessed by measuring the minimum detectable duration
of a gap in a continuous sound. The gap detection is in the order of 2 to 3 ms for tones at moderate and high sound
pressure levels (Exner, 1875; Ostroff et al., 2003; Plomp, 1964).

A gap detection threshold
exceeding 15 ms is considered abnormal (Keith, Young and McCroskey, 1999)

The minimum detectable gap duration in continuous signals is very similar to the gap duration required to hear
two similar clicks as separate events. Such temporal resolution is about 1.5 to 3 ms (Hirsch, 1959; Wallach,
Newman and Rosenzweig, 1949), but it may increase to 10 ms for clicks that are greatly dissimilar (Leshowitz,
1971).


Temporal order discrimination requires substantially longer time intervals than temporal resolution or gap
detection. The time difference required to determine the order of two sound onsets is to the order of
approximately 30 to 60 ms. 
 If the sounds overlap in time but have
different onset times, they are heard as starting at the different points in time if their onset times differ by more
than about 20 ms (Hirsh, 1959; Hirsch and Sherrick, 1961).

For example, the duration of a short pause (gap) between two stimuli (e.g., 250 ms) is underestimated by
25% or more if it is preceded by another shorter pause (Suetomi and Nakajama, 1998). This effect is known as
“time shrinking” and is an important element of music perception. It also has been reported that presentation of
sound-distracter affects visual time-order perception (Dufour, 1999; McDonald et al., 2005)

Mauk and Buonomano (2004) reported that experts can understand Morse codes at rates of 40 to 80
words per minute (wpm), which for 40 wpm, results in timed events of 30, 90, 30, and 90 ms, respectively. 


The maximum duration of the stimulus through which the temporal summation effect operates is called critical
duration. According to many studies, the critical duration for pure tone signals is approximately 200 to 300 ms

. The threshold of hearing is higher for durations shorter than the critical duration and decreases
at a rate of about 3 dB per doubling of duration (Zwislocki, 1960). For example, for 100-μsec square-wave clicks
presented at the rate of 10 Hz, the threshold of hearing is in the order of 35 dB SPL (Stapells, Picton and Smith,
1982), while the hearing threshold for continuous white noise is near 0 dB SPL.

and informational maskers, which have masking capabilities due to their similarity to the target sound.

 Dynamic visual acuity (DVA) is crucial for the perception of moving objects.
 The results revealed superior DVA and eye movement in the horizontal direction compared with the vertical direction (𝑝<0.001). 
 This highlights the anisotropic characteristics of DVA and eye movement.

So approx 3Hz and 3dB.  
Controlling the velocity on the keyboard is not so easy, so this must be a range description.  
Yeah we should have far more depth in the key structure around the middle octaves.  
New format keyboards make an attempt to do this.  

#ROLI 
This may be more interesting than the current default side/side motion.  
We could potentially create interesting sequences which chromatic-like patterns at another level.  
Make it configurable.  


I still think we get a lot, even if it is closer to 10ms rather than 5ms.  

Auditory perception just has some advantages over the visual system.  
Time is built in to the perception naturally.  



and color adjustment are fine.  



How was Morse code developed?  


When we zoom in and out of time, how do we want the timeline/pianoroll to display?  
Essentially information density should be a dynamic setting.  
And regardless of speed this should be propagated.  
How should this be filtered is a question we currently are not doing very well on.

Can we get a level of time accuracy that is acceptable in the UI?  Eventually..


How to make a heirarchical structure in words?  
This would be most convenient for the input mechanism.  
Also how do we translate the logical structures?  

Each word potentially translates to a function, but is this too much?  
I think it's ok.

Only load images if it is actually used in the feedback/rec.

For temporary solution for adoption, lets name each key on the keyboard.  
Octaves should have the symetric naming.  
And the symetry within the octave should be represented in the names.
