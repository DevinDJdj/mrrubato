Seaboard Block M messages not detected by webmidi.  
**web/public/midi.js
What messages are we getting?  
			input.channels[1].addListener("midimessage", (event) => {console.log(event); getMIDIMessage(event.data); });


The remaining channels (usually Channels 2–16) are used to transmit notes and expressive data – 
including note-on velocity, pitch bend, channel pressure (aftertouch), CC74 (brightness), and note-off (release) velocity – 
on a note-per-channel basis. The expressive data will only apply to the note which is on the same channel.

So we are getting the notes per channel.  
And the expression on those notes.  
So need a channel->Note lookup.  
Not great design.  
We are jumping around channels based on the note.  
reverse engineering:
Last message from MPE:
135, 66, 12
NOTEOFF, NOTE, ?

NOTEOFF ()


152, 70, 2
NOTEON, NOTE, ?

NOTEON = NOTEOFF + 16
So if NOTEON is 135, then NOTEOFF comes on 151
etc.  
129 - 144, 145-159

For now just capture this.  

**web/public/midi.js
Should we have LastNote per device?
