Make voice interactive simple game for reference.  

**server/game
For a text, create a RAG based on time in the text.  
not sure best approach.  
Simple time based 
Or potentially just use the LLM.js in local browser with these rag dataset. 
Could use something simple like this
https://github.com/MattDClarke/Voice-controlled-snake-game
Really looking for a library which has some intelligence and story ability.  
Or at least something based on a common Gaming engine.

Some curious links from here:

Passing the wav files to the browser should not be hard.  
Essentially create a Narration based on the book.  


##LLM.js
LLM.js needs to add a RAG functionality.  
Then this would be much simpler.  

https://blog.streamlit.io/using-time-based-rag-llm-apps-with-timescale-vector/

Basically making DB shards, and querying the ones which are relevant.  
Yes this makes sense.  


**web/public/analyze.html
have a flag to not load voice interaction.  
And jump to location.  
Find similar sequences of midi (words/sentences) and jump to those locations.  




**web/pubic/game/text-engine/

Let's just use something like this and create realistic voice, and narrate a choose-your-own adventure story.  
Using different character and narrator voice.  
https://github.com/huggingface/parler-tts
https://github.com/okaybenji/text-engine
Combine this with the actual transcript whatever it is.  
This is a pretty decent little library.  
Can we make this more dynamic/natural somehow with LLM.js?  
Make a minimap of discovered area.  
We can probably just create this.  
Story component, then minimap, and then graphical component.  
Let's make a real image.  


Best is if we have all in javascript, but we can get the voice for now from another engine for fun.  
Until TTS customization is built in to browsers.  

Use this simple framework with custom voice generation and then possibly custom image generation.  
Simple service to serve the voice prompt.  
For now custom TTS leave it be.  
Then possibly continue the generation.  
https://github.com/TencentARC/SEED-Story

Where can we get the original story?  


Anyway, for now just integrate the LLM.js with text-engine.  
Talk to can be a random query to the LLM with prompt.  
Similar prompt regarding character/voice aspect to parler-tts.  

Use LLM to find location, and use dynamically generated story and dynamically generated map.  
Can we generate an interesting story in this way?  

For now just allow it to not have story line.  
Generate location, voice, items in the scene.  
what can you do with this item.  If something comes up in the further story, allow use of this item.  
Simply if the use makes sense.  
So all dynamic, but just complete chaotic story.  

Show minimap for known locations within X radius.  
Generate dynamic distances between a, b for map generation.  
Perhaps just display the map on the background of the text div?  

**web/public/testllm.html
        const write_result = (line) => {

        const run_complete = () => {

Use these two functions to speak.  


OK, so have interactive speech.  
But the LLM results are pretty bad.  
Should allow for random interaction with backend LLM as well.  

Now integrate this with the gaming UI, and read sentence by sentence.  

Get random number of exits (1-8) N,NE,E,SE,S,SW,W,NW


Get random location in a city - Just make a list.  
Could just use OSM or something.  
https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/
https://github.com/OptimalLearner/Leaflet-JS-Example-Code


Maybe just use real-world map and generate the story and items.  
Allow to go to location and generate a story based on what is near there.  
Just pick random locations between the point of origin and the destination.  

Goal is to try to find someone.  
Pick a location for the goal and have them describe what they see.  
Different kind of geoguessr.  


Get random items - Just use the location to generate items that might be found here.  
Generate minimap and item info.  

This LLM not really good enough for what I want to do.  
But I want it in the browser.  

**web/public/game/testmap.html
https://gist.github.com/tyrasd/45e4a6a44c734497e82ccaae16a9c9ea

This seems to work ok after changing to https://
So use this to get overlay info.  
And then generate the game from here.  

Dont actually show the map.  
or show only where we have travelled.  
Generate the story from here.  

What is the goal though?  

OK, lets just add the actual map to the game UI.  
For now random location is fine. 

Can we have P2P data transfer?  
I guess we could have this for currently online.  
Simple in-memory server.  
Nah.. if we do this, we need to create DB and backend becomes more complex.  
Or can we keep this real-time data in the current DB in a meaningful way?  
If we use location names and sub-location names, then probably fine.  


Describe the location based on the city name and a location within that city.  
20 questions / battleship combo.  No visuals just noises generated and descriptions generated by AI?  

Determine radius for win.  
Randomly, see how smaller larger radius changes the game.  

Can only go a direction and distance.  
Choose exact bearing and distance.  
tell general direction and distance.  
And user has to move from their original location exact bearing and distance.  
Either move, if land within X radius of other player, win.  
Dynamic radius based on how far away they are.  

-turn based
-timer to choose action
/move (max distance)
/get hint
/hide (minimize radius single turn)
Gets smaller as game goes on?  

after each turn the other player is notified of the action taken.  
And given some info.  
/move gets general direction of the move or general distance of the move.  
/hint gets to see the same hint.  So if too good, can move
/hide other users knows the radius

Keep all dialogue and list of hints/moves etc in the scrolling text.  
Map will show all moves as POI #1, #2, etc.  
Bonus for getting within the radius.  
Value changes for how close to bulls-eye.  
Points given though for getting closer.  

Start > 2* max distance to be fair.  

Will the LLM be good enough to generate hints that are useful?  
Maybe randomly good/bad hints will be interesting.  



...
perhaps some other functions.  
Minimal movement gives points.  
Grade on each move, distance closed or distance widened.  



Why am I not displaying meta words?  

Need to show some more feedback on commands being run.  
Print out a console of at least going through the command.  

The Roland keyboard when BT is on causes some issues.

Power/Mode button at the bottom left

Ugh, still have note duplication somewhere.  
I think I save twice the notes which were loaded.  
OK hopefully fixed.  
remember the var is not local to the function unless explicitly declared.   

Display immediately after update.  

Nice, I think that works.  

**web/public/analyze.html
getFeedbackImage
Have to get the actual words, not the midi array.  


Check out Llama 3.2 image functionality.  
>ollama run llama3.2 
https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-stack


Rearrange 
wordtimes["lang"]["word"][]
wordtimes[lang][word][user]
to time based.  
langindex["lang"]

getWords(start, end, filter)
timebased array of words (user, lang, word)
time -> {user, lang, word, ...}

**languages.js
filterWords()
finish this.  
Add start/end time.  

With the feedback, mimic the midi word playback mechanism
-AAAAAA--EEE
--BB---
----CC-
------D
for example.  
200, so perhaps 5 down or 10 down.  
Depending on setting.  
Use different color text, perhaps do this by user.  
Dynamically change the user reference color map?  
No, keeping colors the same is probably best.  




OK, maybe this is working ok.  

Need to add the simple text to the overlay.  



**web/public/analyze.html
