**web/public/game
Make voice interactive simple game for reference.  

**server/game
For a text, create a RAG based on time in the text.  
not sure best approach.  
Simple time based 
Or potentially just use the LLM.js in local browser with these rag dataset. 
Could use something simple like this

Really looking for a library which has some intelligence and story ability.  
Or at least something based on a common Gaming engine.

Passing the wav files to the browser should not be hard.  
Essentially create a Narration based on the book.  


##LLM.js
LLM.js needs to add a RAG functionality.  
Then this would be much simpler.

Basically making DB shards, and querying the ones which are relevant.  
Yes this makes sense.  


**web/public/analyze.html
have a flag to not load voice interaction.  
And jump to location.  
Find similar sequences of midi (words/sentences) and jump to those locations.

Let's just use something like this and create realistic voice, and narrate a choose-your-own adventure story.  
Using different character and narrator voice.  
https://github.com/huggingface/parler-tts
https://github.com/okaybenji/text-engine
Combine this with the actual transcript whatever it is.  
This is a pretty decent little library.  
Can we make this more dynamic/natural somehow with LLM.js?  
Make a minimap of discovered area.  
We can probably just create this.  
Story component, then minimap, and then graphical component.  
Let's make a real image.  


Best is if we have all in javascript, but we can get the voice for now from another engine for fun.  
Until TTS customization is built in to browsers.  

Use this simple framework with custom voice generation and then possibly custom image generation.  
Simple service to serve the voice prompt.  
For now custom TTS leave it be.  
Then possibly continue the generation.

Where can we get the original story?
