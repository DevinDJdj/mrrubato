Perhaps the meta-language needs a time component to it.  
This way it can be used in other languages as well to reflect 
a recursive type meaning.  
0->7->4->5->9->8->3->2->6->11->1->12

Lets play this.  

Maybe this needs to be closure

So words may be like:
ABCDaA
I like this a little because we are going back to begin a new word.  

AaA
AaaA


Change to peertube.  
Or is there another alternative.  
Anyway, wanted to refactor.  

Annoyances of Youtube and lack of control.  


Should we have 
./install.py in each directory, maybe this mechanism is good enough.  
There must be a better mechanism.  
We could use the requirements.txt mechanism, essentially the same.  


Step1: 
OBS
Try to switch to mp4 format so that we can upload and use 
video tag instead of youtube.  

Step2:
adjust upload process

Step3: 
finish videotest.html
