やりたいこと多すぎ。

Create the structure around analyzing the midi data.  
Just have a link to the prev note within each note structure, and you can go back through the list.  
This allows us from any note to attempt to predict the next note.  
Really in the simplest fashion this is what we want to do, predict the next midi value.  
And we can extrapolate from there, even if the next midi value is predicted, we can go beyond that to extend.  

We really need to get the sheet music in digital format.  
Lets just generate the midi file from the sheet music in mechanical format.  
That way we have an original midi file without any musical postulation.  
Perhaps this is sufficient and we dont actually need any actual written sheet music.  
How do we do this though without inhibiting what we play.  
I dont want to restrict playing to only things that have digital sheet music.  

Started very simple class to allow for iteration across messages.  

Interesting to listen to some of the people actually making AI say they dont quite really know how it is working.  
Neural networks have been around for a long time, I remember originally playing with them and Genetic algorithms long ago.  
The concepts were interesting, but really the only reason they are able to be applied now is just due to the vast amount of data which is available.  
This is more a key in what is being done I think than what has actually changed in the concept at least of neural networks.  
However with depth of network, you get additional complexity for sure.  
I have to review the mathematical algorithms utilized here for sure when I start coding this.  
But if we can understand a bit more about our learning process along with the machine learning process, this will likely enhance communication.  
But this is also a very touchy topic.  
Right now we have only minimal "invasion" into personal mind, but proper usage of this can probably enhance things significantly.  
One of those things will likely be enhanced learning.  
How do we contain misuse of this is a different question.  I am more interested in what is possible at the moment.  
Without knowing what is possible it is hard to limit it.  
For now I think the first thing I will do is try to create something to predict next notes or next words based on the training set.  
This personal data along with the breadth of data which is being accumulated across the internet will be extremely powerful.  
-How do we use this
-How do we use this morally
