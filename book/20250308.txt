Need to do one match in order to have sample data.  
Did we ever finish creating the language?  

Yeah lets use part of this for TTS and then 
#https://github.com/lxe/wasm-gpt?tab=readme-ov-file

**web/public/db.html
Does the export actually work with large amount of data?  

Add import..


**web/public/page.html
**web/public/test/sensors/gesture/index.html
add sensor to page.  

**web/public/test/testfilbert.html
**web/public/test/testacorn.html
Can we use this struct to generate a DOT graph?  


**timestep.py
--Add spin up / spin down of backend.  
And wait...
Then we get some transcriptions if there is available hardware at the time of timestep.py


**FLOW

--book

**web/public/test/whisper/testwhisper.html

Perhaps switch speech.js to use this.  
#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79406943/using-whisper-cpp-in-sveltekit
yep, same.  


**web/public/analyze.html
Need to add tabs to this.  
Tab for reviewing topic images.  
Lets just review the image when clicking

If topic not found, load book portion.  

Change the build context to use this last.  

What should default query be?  


**web/public/codewindow.js
not great...
Try to get a sample running.  


**web/public/analyze.html
mobilenet needs GPU.  
So image analysis will not work otherwise. 
Still saves data, but no image analysis will occur.  

**web/public/db.js
Try classifierDB->saveKNN
getKNN
--here still...


How do we snapshot the models?  
Do we want models to be per topic?  
Probably both per topic and general.  
Not sure how large the general will get though.  
Then combine the results of general language classifier and topic specific language classifier.  
To find other iterations of the words.  




Also VideoSnapper should have more details in logic based on language.  This should probably be a dynamic function call.  

VideoSnapper.buildFrames
    if (lang=="base"){ //just taking ~ piano portion of the output.  


  setClassifierDataset(classDatasetMatrices: {[label: string]: Tensor2D}) {
    this.clearTrainDatasetMatrix();

    this.classDatasetMatrices = classDatasetMatrices;
    for (const label in classDatasetMatrices) {
      this.classExampleCount[label] = classDatasetMatrices[label].shape[0];
    }
  }


**web/public/book.html
Need find functionality.  
Search within book and/or code.  
Add all to flexsearch and then query it.  
**web/public/git.js
--initGitIndex
**web/public/db.js
gitDB.ftsindex

Keep ftsindex in DB struct.  

**GENBOOK
add annotations after Q/A.  
--mynote

inside of answer we may have markup sometimes.  So should ignore ** within ANSWER 
between == $$
Not sure this is possible practical.  


Interesting way to possibly write a book as well.  
Significant redundancy though I would expect.  
There is always a bit of boilerplate to the responses from the LLM.  
But a small amount of that is good I think.  Very tough to balance.  



#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79406943/using-whisper-cpp-in-sveltekit

Lets run in local node.

#https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/master/examples/whisper.wasm
build and output.  

**web/public/test/whisper/out/index.html
This seems to work better if built.  
So go through build process...
>mkdir build-em && cd build-em
>emcmake cmake ..
>make -j

# copy the produced page to your HTTP path
>cp bin/whisper.wasm/*    /path/to/html/
>cp bin/libmain.worker.js /path/to/html/


OK, that seems to work.  
So is it/it is worth the trouble to change out all of the webkit.SpeechRecognition.  

Lets try it i.e. in book and see if we speak more.  
Combine with testwhisper to automate getting audio.  
Add gesture to start/stop audio, and test to make sure we can get useful transcription and input.  
Good test case.  
This can be in addition to using midi device.  
LEFT WINK = lastspokenword = "comment"
comment 
RIGHT WINK = lastspokenword = "..."
Handle gesture through the same linguistic arrangement.  

**web/public/gesturemap.js
gesturemap .. same as keymap...
combine with this.  
**web/public/test/sensors/gesture/script.js
**web/public/test/sensors/gesture/index.html


**web/public/analyze.html
Just load this and transcribe in page for analyze.html
Or have a button to do so.  
If we automate this, then that becomes part of the workflow.  


**web/public/recent.html
List transcription status.  
which items have not been transcribed.  

**web/public/test/whisper/out/helper.js
put hand in here.  
Would have thought it would be easier to get the results.  
Lot of overhead, but should work.  
--still need to get audio from video file.

How to save this event chain.  
In transcript.  
Export/import transcript.  
Need topic selection as part of transcript.  

Context doesnt need to be communicated, only event chain.  
Topic selection
and user query.  
No generated responses for the moment.  
This becomes too bloated.  
May need to revisit.

Not yet what I want but at least getting the audio buffer.

Adjust here to get from video and auto press buttons to get transcript.  
If needed can add minimal UI similarly in analyze.html



**record.py
Should really store audio only separately...


#https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/rest/retrieve-data#shallow
Can we use this on video listings?  
May want to make a separate transcript tree.  
Firebase limitation of document-based structure.  

/transcript
byvideo and byuser.  

/comments
byvideo and byuser.  

Yeah probably do this before adding transcript data from audio extraction.  

Once transcription working, make default to not transcribe in timestep.py

How to mark recent changes.  
How to select only most relevant text to pass to LLM?  
This will be solved in future anyway.  I think the current context window should be ok.  
We are only around ~100KB.  


**web/public/keymap.js

1 = top LEFT
3 = mid LEFT
6 = mid
8 = mid RIGHT
10 = top RIGHT
2,4,7,9,11

This sequence defines the concept.  
But what could the divisions be.

Not sure an example..


LANG offset utilize part-of-speech

**web/public/test/whisper/out/indexa.html
OK that kind of works.  
Now add gesture to capture and transcribe audio on gesture.  
Also need to get output text.  
Have to change to 16000 sample rate, but then we get something...

Yeah base is significantly better than tiny.  
For the moment use this.  


Use this textarea formatting perhaps for the transcript window as well.  

Some issue using Gesture and Whisper at the same time.  
//createFaceLandmarker();
breaks other model functionality.

Looks closer maybe.

Can use one after the other, but not simultaneously yet.  
Something still getting overwritten.

replace all:

OK finally seems to work with both on after this.

This is a limitation we dont want though.

What to do with this though anyway.  
Basically should iterate, make code change suggestions.  
Make actual branches and changes, and run as branch.

Or just deploy here:

Then use this with AI agent to record and annotate for review.  
Continue to change/use under branch.

Seems to be demanding too much to use gesture and whisper.  
Gesture keeps freezing...
Whole chrome tab frozen.  

Hmmm, seems cant use both at the same time...
Once we kick off the whisper, we can re-enable the gesture detection.  
Not sure it is stable enough to use....

--somewhat better.
