Add map to this.  
make all LLM load functionality invisible.  
So Essentially Transcript and map will be enough for now.  
We can add the fancy function call logic later.  
Or some fancy UI component from text-engine.  
Ask questions and move.  
We can just have a leaderboard of a GPS location.  
Just pick random location.  
For now this is in the same browser, but hidden from the user.  
They can reveal if they want.  

Not sure this javascript LLM is good enough to do what I want, but the premise is interesting.  

continue with this, layout is not nice.  
but we have voice and map and LLM.  


#pick random target location
#pick random start point (radius parameter)
#loop (difficulty)
#hint (generated from LLM about location)
#move (point feedback)
#repeat
#win (moved within goal radius)
#lose (moved too many times)

Dont think this javascript LLM is sufficient yet.  
Maybe wait for next release with better model.  
Maybe a few years.
