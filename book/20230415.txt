OK, so we have started using internal DB.  
Need to only do updates through this though now.  
This will take some time, so until this is done with analyze.html, 
we may have some out of sync data with this and the youtube comments.  
Dont really care at the moment.  
Now we have record.py->analyze.py
Next
analyze.py->analyze.html
