OK, so we have started using internal DB.  
Need to only do updates through this though now.  
This will take some time, so until this is done with analyze.html, 
we may have some out of sync data with this and the youtube comments.  
Dont really care at the moment.  
Now we have record.py->analyze.py
Next
analyze.py->analyze.html

shouldnt open analyze.html except for once.  
Figure out how many we want to run analyze on.  
Perhaps previous two years?  

this is working now, but we have to open only once, seems we are opening several times.  

Still to consider:
de-sync from youtube DB.  
analyze.html save from here to DB.  
Only update youtube data with batch?  
This is probably simplest solution.  
But then we need to only allow owner of the channel to do the editing to that branch of the DB.  
Can we make such a rule?  
Maybe others can use the site as is, and then just use that channel based on user login.  
Wont get multiple channels I wouldnt think, but maybe make it possible to allow for in the future.  




Overall good progress this weekend I think.  
Consolidating the process into a few steps was good.  

--index.html
Next make general index first.  
Then make the update via analyze.html.  


add this write rule.  
Then get the userID when using the page.  
right now analyze.html only thing which will write anything.  

why are the rules deleted.  
keep the rules here, these are what gets written.  
--web/database.rules.json

OK, not a great solution, but for now this is ok.  
I sign in and can update.  
Eventually allow for any update based on the UID
Allow that user to have their own data.  
Perhaps lets just add the user comments to the video underneath the video data.  
And any user can edit their own comments.  
Have a separate textbox for other user comments?  

Then we can combine all comments.  
Have one video entry which we can control, then any user can comment as they wish underneath the video entry.  
And we can index that data and pull that data to display.  
We should save the user name.  
We can save the audio as well perhaps eventually.  
For now lets just add it to the video or around where the video is playing.  
Then we can choose to show the user or block the user from the UI.
