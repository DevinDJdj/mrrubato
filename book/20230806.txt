Cant play due to tendonitis in the wrist.  
Unfortunately I think playing not with the right form caused this.  
Bit depressing that I cant play but I may be able to use the time to teach the kids.  
Or perhaps I can use this time to reflect or do a bit more programming.  

Really need to create something like 
**history.py
this should show info across iterations.  
Focus on general progress across songs, compared to other songs etc.  
What is the timing between iterations, and what is the best use of time overall.  

Finally fixed the annoying problem that analyze.py was taking too much time synchronously.  

Try to utilize some of the things I have been testing for video manipulation.  
Also need to still generate some image from sound.  

Too many things to do, not enough time and/or inspiration.
