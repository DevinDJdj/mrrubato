Cant play due to tendonitis in the wrist.  
Unfortunately I think playing not with the right form caused this.  
Bit depressing that I cant play but I may be able to use the time to teach the kids.  
Or perhaps I can use this time to reflect or do a bit more programming.  

Really need to create something like 
**history.py
this should show info across iterations.  
Focus on general progress across songs, compared to other songs etc.  
What is the timing between iterations, and what is the best use of time overall.  

Finally fixed the annoying problem that analyze.py was taking too much time synchronously.  

Try to utilize some of the things I have been testing for video manipulation.  
Also need to still generate some image from sound.  

Too many things to do, not enough time and/or inspiration.  

**analyze.py
add some logic to detect at least the harmonic correlations between notes.  
Change midi -> Hz and find correlations.  

Can we visualize something which will actually represent the sound itself, like a wave.  
multiple note frequencies.  
Beat frequencies.  A - B
If the beat frequency of two waves or tones is in the mid-frequency range (500 - 2000 Hz), then our ear perceives it as a third wave/tone

Yeah for now just do a realtime sound visualization.  
Then we will have a sequence of sounds visualized.  
We also want context.

This is interesting:

No reason not to make the keyboard a keyboard.  
Dont have weight though.  
Can we get weight from keys?

First of all just stick with piano for now.  
Do all things we can do to improve that.  

Need to detect fingers with midi.  

Then detect patterns along with speed.  
Which patterns are preferable for certain sets of notes.  
Then we find the most useful fingering patterns for the person.  
And compare to other fingering patterns.  
start with this perhaps:

Add the visualization like above instead of the keyboard when I am showing the screen.  
Also what to display instead of facecam.  
Display what is being created, but how to represent that?  
Maybe just display the last image visualization I guess.  Stick with that idea for a while.  

Need to use the program to remove empty audio space as well especially if we start sharing what is being done on the computer.  
This way there is no post-processing necessary.  



Also detect the mathematics in the note sets.  
Have some Midi->notepattern like referred above for analyze.py
And then visualize that note pattern in a way that is useful and has the mathematical structures correlated.  

We should be able to do this while playing.  In record, we should be able to detect realtime the finger structures
and add suggestions perhaps from past reference of recordings.  
Wont get this real-time immediately, just focus on being able to do it properly.  
Then see how close to real-time we can get.  
We can perhaps just do it in analyze, and display those results.  
Not necessarily while playing.  

Create some music with some interesting beat frequencies, so that the beat frequencies are harmonic in a way along with the original notes.
