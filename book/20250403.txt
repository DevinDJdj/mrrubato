Need to do one match in order to have sample data.  
Did we ever finish creating the language?  


**web/public/db.html
Does the export actually work with large amount of data?  

Add import..


**web/public/page.html
**web/public/test/sensors/gesture/index.html
add sensor to page.  
**web/public/test/whisper/outa/indexa.html
continue here, integrate into PAGE/BOOK

Can we use this struct to generate a DOT graph?  


**timestep.py
--Add spin up / spin down of backend.  
And wait...
Then we get some transcriptions if there is available hardware at the time of timestep.py
Alternatively move transcriptions (enable/disable) to

5 = complete selection.  

0 = word start.  
12 = (extra octave -> Exponential depth?  as opposed to linear correlation) 
Not sure an example..


LANG offset utilize part-of-speech
LANG offset:
0 = META (design where primarily utilize RIGHT side)
2 = BASE
4 = MODIFIER LANGUAGE (what is this)

Possible time designation.  
LEFT = past
0 = META unknown past
1 = Beginning of time being discussed.  
2 = Beginning of time being discussed, possibility.  
3 = During the past action
4 = possibility during past action
5 = complete
6 = now
7 = potential now
8 = near future
9 = potential near future
10 = far future
11 = potential far future.

Going the other way I'm sure is fairly easy.

Build VSCode plugin and it should interact with the local installation via cmd line.  
This is for detailed analysis.  
Get context from web, paste into plugin... get response.  
Interaction to update code pages or not....
Significant amount of interaction here.  
But perhaps the suggestion is more important.  
Point to location in code and suggestion.  
Open code location/paste with link from chat.  

Future possibility to auto-run..
