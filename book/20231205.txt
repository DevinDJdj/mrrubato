Todo:
Look into the localGPT options we have.  
https://github.com/PromtEngineer/localGPT

Continue with setup of alternate machine.  


Case sensitivity not supported by the realtimedb, forget for now.  

Set up machine for transcription service to start.  
Add this to the repository.  
Can be run locally or remotely.  

**record.py 
should check that it is available prior to start.  
Need config param for this server.  
What general server to use?  Stick with python I think.  
or autostart it.  

really need to go back and read what was spoken on previous iterations.  
This is a good way to get a summary.  
Probably should generate a summary after we get the better quality transcription.  
It is song, so the transcription is not great, but it does pick up some it seems.  
i.e. p_JAbn0GHEE


embed this in a web UI?
