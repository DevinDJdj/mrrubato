I really can't speak eloquently for any sustained period of time.  
This is not due to the fact that I dont have a sufficient mastery of English or language.  
Instead it is likely because my mind is not train-of-thought sequenced and not language-centered.  
The tangents are followed in real-time.  
And coming back to the origin of thought can be difficult.  
This all depends on how far I take each tangent and how many tangents there are.  
Of course this also correlates to the length of each pause.  (4s)
Following this train of thought, written form probably generates more useful content for the consumer in my case.  
But to me the original tangents are what are of primary interest.  
They are only fleeting, and dont always correlate to language in any meaningful way, but they are the essence of being.  
In any meaningful way, 
anyway...

I hope time will be kind to allow me to share some creations over time.  
Not that I have anything more to share than any other soul, but I chose to share some now.  
I have lived through the social media revolution, mostly observing.  
But when I saw the possibilities that can be achieved now by the organization of a driven group of people, or even sometimes an individual using technology, 
I decided to share in the hopes that whatever is created may someday prove useful or intriguing to others in their creations.  
In the rare chance some of my creations do prove useful, I only ask 21.
