**server/transcription/server.py
Need update of STT to use Deepspeech or similar.  
I guess try this:

**testing/DeepSpeech
git clone https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech.git

python3 -m venv /mnt/c/devinpiano/testing/deepspeech-venv/
source /mnt/c/devinpiano/testing/deepspeech-venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements_transcribe.txt
pip3 install deepspeech
pip3 install ds_ctcdecoder
pip3 install tensorflow
pip3 install -U numpy
pip3 install sox


import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.test.is_gpu_available())


**generate/tennis.py
Try a new tack.  
**generate/exceltocsv.py
See if we can generate something interesting just with this data.  
Unfortunate the data doesnt have time of match.  
See other datasets.  

Kaggle match dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/ultimate-tennis-matches-dataset
This looks ok I guess, nothing significantly better.  
Use data after 2005. 
Before that slightly different format.  
20 years of data should be sufficient.  
Generate track for each player.  
Time must stand for time.  
But otherwise how to represent?  
Type of court = timbre
??Tournament GPS location use to adjust time forward/backward.  
Series/Tier = volume
Round increase = Crescendo or time play, slow down for further rounds 1.25, 1.5, etc.  
non-playing time will shorten by 2x, 3x, 4x for each set which exists until next match (maybe dont shorten?)
What to represent notes?  
Create player note combo which represents current ranking along with opponent ranking?  
How to represent numbers in general with key combos.
