Very fitting

Tennis test:
Test:
analyze.html?video=mj4jpeBvD2o

Also test multiple tracks (languages) and multiple user feedback.  

add language tennis (-6,6)
--start here.  
analyze.html?video=mj4jpeBvD2o
change language (-6,6)
add word hit (6,6)
how do we have synonyms?  This would get overwritten
Could have something mimicing back and forth across net.  
add word backhand (6,1) 
add word forehand (6,3) 
add word slice (6,2)
add word topspin (6,4)
add word volley (6,8)
add word drop (6,10)
add word serve (10,10)

add word fault (10,11)
add word let (10,9)
add word out (5,5)
add word long (5,11)
add word net (5,2)
add word bounce (4,4)
add word applause (3,4)
add word noise (3,5)

add word score (2,2) (param = 3,4,5,6,7)
2,2 = 0, 2,3=15, 2,4=30, 2,5=40, 2,6=AD, 2,7=GAME, 2,8=SET, 2,9=MATCH
2,1 = replay do we need?  Doesnt hurt.  

add word player one (3,1)
add word player two (3,11)
3,1 = set player 1
3,11 = set player 2

3,1,2,3 = player 1 = 15



Should we return a state?  
This would be like score and serve state etc.  
Score counted etc.  
Display state on screen near video.  

Also to start maybe we want to add all the translated language to the comments.
