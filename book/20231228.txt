Lets use this modus operandi for watching on one machine and creating on the other.  
This will be a useful way to do things.  

**web/public/analyze.html
Cant do autosave, but perhaps remind after certain period of time.  
Also make sure we can save and then resave.  This is what is preventing.  
Need to make sure update and re-update works.  I think we have already tested this
in a rudimentary way.  

**web/public/chat.html
webrtc

**web/public/watch.html
Show watch list.  Show video details, are we able to get, I forget.  
Save where left off.  Update the RTDB every minute or so if watching.  
Same for analyze.html?  Only save video timer.  


**web/public/history.html
Show created list along with search filter. 
Search filter needs to search the transcripts as well. 
Just load everything and use javascript?  
For now this is ok, but perhaps need a better solution.  

**web/public/users.html
Only visible to logged in users.  
How many comments, review time.  
Inside of here, show preference.  
Per user, there will be "favorite" or similar mechanism.  
NxN map, just store favorites and then have a calculation.
