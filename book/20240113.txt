This combines with Recordrtc
Variety of things to do.  
Image recognition and description generation.  
Essentially real-time descriptive audio generation.  
In time feedback generation for communication in analyze.  
I would like to use the midi controller, but we can always allow for just clicking on the

Need to do languages.html.  

pip install torchviz
pip install tensorboard

Can we use this?  
peertube.org
Use this with the recordrtc results.  
And then expand this with the midi info as well?  

Not sure using Youtube is best.  
At least create a scaffolding for using another service.  
Need to do this with DB as well as Video Service.
