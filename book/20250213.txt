**web/public/rec.html
switch all service calls to indexeddb.  
--OK, easier than I thought to get this working.  Nice.  
--can we use FTS?  
this should be automated to save on stop recording?  
Or use saveLocal button?  Yes I think this will be fine.  


**web/public/db.html
What do we want to do here.  What should DB be named?  
use same schema?  
Does the export actually work with large amount of data?  

Add import..
Continue switching the service.py

**web/public/git.js
--selectGitRepo
--initGitIndex
ftsindex how to use this local search?  


**web/public/book.html
When we load changes
Load a graph which shows relationship between files.  
Switch between this graph and the word2vec SVG.  
Be able to select the change and keep it in the code editor.  
More changes at same time = fatter graph edge.  
Each node should be selectable and show changes correlated to the originally selected file.  
A separate link should just load the file same as timewindow.  

--gitgraph
