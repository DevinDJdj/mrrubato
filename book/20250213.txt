Yep:

**0606
Need to do one match in order to have sample data.  
Did we ever finish creating the language?  


#https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/blob/master/examples/whisper.wasm/index-tmpl.html

Yeah lets use part of this for TTS and then 
#https://github.com/lxe/wasm-gpt?tab=readme-ov-file


**web/public/recent.html
Add stats like number of transcribed words and/or summary of transcript.  
reorganize table column sizes.  

**web/public/rec.html
**web/public/rec.js
saveTranscript/loadTranscripts
saveLocal/saveRemote
indicate whether this is private/public.  
#https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Using_IndexedDB

**web/public/test/testdexie.html
**web/public/js/flexsearch/test.html

**web/public/config.js
Make a class at least even if not full ES6.  
Leave original vars.  

**web/public/grammar/midi.ne
**web/public/grammar/keys/keys.ne
Try simplistic number sequence -> word generation.  

**web/public/grammar/book/booka.ne

**web/public/test/sensors/gesture.js
--onFaceResults

Adjust this to recognize 
Eyebrow raise/lower
Head nod/NESW
Eye closure

**web/public/timewindow.js
When item is selected, this window jumps to the bottom.  
Need to fix that. 


#https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphageometry


**web/public/rec.html
switch all service calls to indexeddb.  
--OK, easier than I thought to get this working.  Nice.  
--can we use FTS?  
this should be automated to save on stop recording?  
Or use saveLocal button?  Yes I think this will be fine.  


**web/public/db.html
What do we want to do here.  What should DB be named?  
use same schema?  
Does the export actually work with large amount of data?  

Add import..
Continue switching the service.py

**web/public/git.js
--selectGitRepo
--initGitIndex
ftsindex how to use this local search?  


**web/public/book.html
When we load changes
Load a graph which shows relationship between files.  
Switch between this graph and the word2vec SVG.  
Be able to select the change and keep it in the code editor.  
More changes at same time = fatter graph edge.  
Each node should be selectable and show changes correlated to the originally selected file.  
A separate link should just load the file same as timewindow.  

--gitgraph

**web/public/timewindow.js
Continue with filter files.  
#https://visjs.github.io/vis-timeline/examples/timeline/groups/visibleGroups.html
#https://visjs.github.io/vis-timeline/examples/timeline/groups/groupsEditable.html

groups.update({
    id: group.id,
    visible: false
});

in our case vgroups
--groupFromName

Need filter in/out
For now just use delimited folders.  
i.e.
web/public/game;web/public/js;generate;

and in/out flag.  
Clear filter...

and find files...
search by name.  

Or use selectedtopics and all correlated.  
Find includes in the source.  
Possibly chain includes....
Maybe this is more practical.  
--hideGroups
--hideItems
--start here.  

end goal?  
Find all changes in timewindow for selectedtopics and includes...

**web/public/test/sensors/gesture/index.html
Gesture recognition.  Lets use this for UI manipulation.  
#https://codepen.io/mediapipe-preview/pen/OJBVQJm
following works well with this model.  
browDownLeft/browDownRight - 0.6
browOuterUpLeft/browOuterUpRight - 0.6
-scroll up/down

eyeBlink - 0.6 sequential number of blinks within period.  
-3 or more ?  

jawOpen/mouthFunnel - 0.3/0.5
-zoom out, 
mouthPucker - 0.98
-zoom in

mouthDimpleRight/mouthDimpleLeft - 0.7
-item selection
mouthRight/mouthLeft - 0.7
-component selection

eyeLookOutRight/eyeLookInLeft - maybe dont use
eyeLookOutLeft/eyeLookInRight - maybe dont use 

Enough to start.  

**web/public/test/sensors/gesture/index.html
--getFaceActions
This seems to work ok.  


**web/public/book.html
Have some performance issues.  
Need to check why we are getting memory crashes after page is active for long idle period.  

How do we generate a dependency graph for the code?  
#https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js?tab=readme-ov-file

already using this
#https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/examples/

Really want text representation first.  
#https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/docs/network/#importDot
hmmm.. DOT representation, dont really like this, but seems to be common.  

Yeah this is probably the way to go to start.  
#https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/examples/network/data/dotLanguage/dotPlayground.html

**web/public/test/testfilbert.html
**web/public/test/testacorn.html
Can we use this struct to generate a DOT graph?  

Yeah, lets do this.  
Not sure these are best libraries, but should be ok.  

BOOK -> PAGE 
**web/public/page.html
generate dot graph from AST and display with visjs.  
Not sure if it will be very useful or not, but..

Try Full ES6
Show full code interaction and dependencies.  
Eventually PAGE dependency graph.  
But for now just select and open new PAGE.  
and interact with graph using gestures.  

**web/public/page.html
Minimal LLM + speech
Move Chat portion to module.  

**web/public/chat.mjs
Also need HTML table UI generation in this module ideally.  
So many annoying things still in coding.  

Need transcript module.  


Make module for midi.js next.  
speech, midi, llm set.  
add this to page.  

Only one LLM loaded in all active pages.  
Use pipes to check/load if necessary.  
Have ability to utilize multiple different LLM?  

Also speech output needs to be singleton.  

**web/public/pipes.js
Need to have ontabactivate function to know which is the latest page
and use this to build the context.  

eventually perhaps MIDI can indicate which tab to utilize.  

rec should be recording in any case.  

**web/public/rec.html
Is there a way to create highlight box on the recorded screen instead of the webpage?  
This would be useful, then the tab doesnt need to be active.  

**web/public/db.js
--recDB getRecent
continue.  
?id=name

Dexie quite finnicky.
