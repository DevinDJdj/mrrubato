**0606
Need to do one match in order to have sample data.  
Did we ever finish creating the language?  


#https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/blob/master/examples/whisper.wasm/index-tmpl.html

Yeah lets use part of this for TTS and then 
#https://github.com/lxe/wasm-gpt?tab=readme-ov-file


**web/public/recent.html
Add stats like number of transcribed words and/or summary of transcript.  
reorganize table column sizes.  

**web/public/rec.html
**web/public/rec.js
saveTranscript/loadTranscripts
saveLocal/saveRemote
indicate whether this is private/public.

**web/public/test/testdexie.html
**web/public/js/flexsearch/test.html

**web/public/config.js
Make a class at least even if not full ES6.  
Leave original vars.  

**web/public/grammar/midi.ne
**web/public/grammar/keys/keys.ne
Try simplistic number sequence -> word generation.  

**web/public/grammar/book/booka.ne

**web/public/test/sensors/gesture.js
--onFaceResults

Adjust this to recognize 
Eyebrow raise/lower
Head nod/NESW
Eye closure

**web/public/timewindow.js
When item is selected, this window jumps to the bottom.  
Need to fix that.

**web/public/rec.html
switch all service calls to indexeddb.  
--OK, easier than I thought to get this working.  Nice.  
--can we use FTS?  
this should be automated to save on stop recording?  
Or use saveLocal button?  Yes I think this will be fine.  


**web/public/db.html
What do we want to do here.  What should DB be named?  
use same schema?  
Does the export actually work with large amount of data?  

Add import..
Continue switching the service.py

**web/public/git.js
--selectGitRepo
--initGitIndex
ftsindex how to use this local search?  


**web/public/book.html
When we load changes
Load a graph which shows relationship between files.  
Switch between this graph and the word2vec SVG.  
Be able to select the change and keep it in the code editor.  
More changes at same time = fatter graph edge.  
Each node should be selectable and show changes correlated to the originally selected file.  
A separate link should just load the file same as timewindow.  

--gitgraph

**web/public/timewindow.js
Continue with filter files.  
#https://visjs.github.io/vis-timeline/examples/timeline/groups/visibleGroups.html
#https://visjs.github.io/vis-timeline/examples/timeline/groups/groupsEditable.html

groups.update({
    id: group.id,
    visible: false
});

in our case vgroups
--groupFromName

Need filter in/out
For now just use delimited folders.  
i.e.
web/public/game;web/public/js;generate;

and in/out flag.  
Clear filter...

and find files...
search by name.  

Or use selectedtopics and all correlated.  
Find includes in the source.  
Possibly chain includes....
Maybe this is more practical.  
--hideGroups
--hideItems
--start here.  

end goal?  
Find all changes in timewindow for selectedtopics and includes...

**web/public/test/sensors/gesture/index.html
Gesture recognition.  Lets use this for UI manipulation.  
#https://codepen.io/mediapipe-preview/pen/OJBVQJm
following works well with this model.  
browDownLeft/browDownRight - 0.6
browOuterUpLeft/browOuterUpRight - 0.6
-scroll up/down

eyeBlink - 0.6 sequential number of blinks within period.  
-3 or more ?  

jawOpen/mouthFunnel - 0.3/0.5
-zoom out, 
mouthPucker - 0.98
-zoom in

mouthDimpleRight/mouthDimpleLeft - 0.7
-item selection
mouthRight/mouthLeft - 0.7
-component selection

eyeLookOutRight/eyeLookInLeft - maybe dont use
eyeLookOutLeft/eyeLookInRight - maybe dont use 

Enough to start.
