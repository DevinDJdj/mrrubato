5 = complete
6 = now
7 = potential now
8 = near future
9 = potential near future
10 = far future
11 = potential far future.

Possible location:
Location conceptual designation
1 = near far
2 = not near anywhere
3 = near 
4 = not near
5 = complete
6 = here
7 = not here
8 = far known
9 = far unknown
10 = unattainably far known
11 = unattainably far unknown

location physical designation
...
1 = left top
2 = left mid
3 = left bot
4 = mid top
5 = complete
6 = here
7 = not here
8 = right top
9 = right mid
10 = right bot
