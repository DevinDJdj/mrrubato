@@How do we manage the comms
RTDB channel.  
On start generate channel entry.  
Does it need to be user-based?  
Single write.  

RTDB "channels"
channels/uid/timestamp
each time we start/stop trey, this is generated..
Also allow split by user cmd.  

When screen toggled, write any QR to channel.  
settings to determine which languages/commands are shared..
channels/uid/settings
Just simple JSON struct, if lang/cmd contained, it is shared.
lang/cmd/var
If var is file, it is populated as Base64 struct..
Dont really need settings in DB..

First lets populate this, and then worry about read structure.  
Generally each user will just share the uid/timestamp, and this data will come as QRIn.  
No need to necessarily display.  
setting whether to display or not..
Top half is IN, bottom half is out.  

How do we start following other user input?  
Different struct for just user comms.  
doors/uid/incoming
doors/uid/outgoing
doors/uid/settings
contains all timestamps for channels..

This is global writable.  
So just write incoming/outgoing uids/timestamps in list, and periodically this is ingested and deleted.  

Keep this local info to read and share any transcripts from that user in top half..
joined, left, screenshot..

Share screen size settings to dynamically adjust BBOX for any screenshots while IN room.  

Probably can detect from size and location of QR code during screen share for instance..
