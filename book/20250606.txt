  mapsgram[ seqgram ] [ pgram ] = { 'time': [], 'iteration': [] }
  mappgram[ signs ] [ pgram ] = { 'time': [], 'iteration': [] }

flatten and analyze by pgram as well as by seqgram etc.  
pgrams that have common factors are similar.  
And also usually close in number value.   


Find avg times per iterations.  
Find if time PCT offsets between iterations matches, we estimate that this is a 
time anchor and the same location in the piece.  
How many repetitions do we have, probably not many due to finger errors.  
First what is the length of these maps.  
Sort most frequent signs and seqgrams.  
See if there is anything interesting in these patterns.  
What does it look like per song and across songs.

How to query state?  
%%
queries all workers.  
%%1
queries worker 1.  
%%1=5 sets worker 1 to worker 5
%%+5 start worker
%%-5 stop worker
%%1=MYWORKERFRIEND name worker.  
%%MYWORKERFRIEND=1 ok if unnamed, if name already exists and is assigned, error please stop or reassign.  
Same if 1 is assigned to another name.  


$$%%MYWORKERFRIEND shows env of this thread.  
$$-%%MYWORKERFRIEND stops worker.  
$$+%%MYWORKERFRIEND creates a numbered duplicate thread of this env.  MYWORKERFRIEND_1
$$%%MYWORKERFRIEND++
$$%%MYWORKERFRIEND--


$$1 queries env from worker 1.  

**extensions/vscode/codetutor/src/tokenizer.tsx

Perhaps train the markov chain as to the likelihood of any particular next ngram.  
And also within the sets of action types in 
defmap,defstring.  
Perhaps we can use this simple model locally to enhance speed.  
This should be a time/duration/NGRAM -> time/duration/NGRAM

Each NGRAM needs to have a time and duration associated.

Keep track of topics selected.  
Randomly add thinking topics based on current cursor location.  
Assume current cursor location is the current thought.  

--pickTopic
getting list of selected topics for query.  
Need to limit to context window.  

@mr /start **TOPIC

Should have map of topic sets.  
%%


Need to test this again.  
@mr /start
@mr /stop


work->roboupdate->updatePrompts

order by:
Time/topic
Instead of 
topic/time

Maybe just organize by topic and time.  
When parsing book, look for %% to initialize worker.  
Worker limit 10 or so.  
Record file/location.  
Take all data until start of next topic.  Or just take this entire topic comment.  

Start and stop a worker, simply by %%
%%? = list all running worker and file locations
%%1 = jump to location.  and show info.  
%%1+ = increase worker time allocation for this thread.  
%%1- = decrease time allocation for this thread.  
%%1-- = scratch worker.  
This will remove the %% in that location so it doesnt start up next time.  
Add details about how long this worker existed, for now just add date.  
%%_YYYYMMDD = ended worker.  
Need an ID for all commits related to this.  
Lets use topic/date?  
%%**TOPIC list active worker for this topic.  
Maybe only one active at a time per topic.  


%%++ = this will dynamically add a worker from this location if it doesnt already exist.  
and remove the ++.  

When initializing and parsing book, get all these threads and start them.  

%%1? = show change summaries with links to details.  

Prompts should be a set of prompt sequences.  
For now can be single.  


Need to separate the search/list from generate function.  
Need two distinct functions.  

Just go to location and run generate command.

#https://github.com/arciisine/vscode-chronicler
perhaps should implement this, not sure if it is useful for our scenario.  

Need separate view though for thought history.  

Just create a webview in vscode, or  perhaps for now just open externally when we generate.  
This will give us the 
vscode.env.openExternal(Uri.parse("page.html.."));


@vscode
--vscode.env.openExternal
~~really should allow to create an ID for a window/tab combination and open/reopen.  
This would be a nice feature.
