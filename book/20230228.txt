I was very communicative today.  
Philosophizing on how the human race may evolve from a variety of perspectives, but mostly due to the capabilities that computers bring.  
This communication revolution enabled by the internet and computer technology is just getting started.  
It is such a fascinating topic.  I am working to improve my communication skills, but not sure how long I should spend contemplating words.  

I am interested in how my mind will recall things that I think about while playing certain songs.  
There are definitely things which I start to associate with certain songs, but not sure that will come through as I often dont talk, 
and what I talk about before/during the song is still quite random.  It is possible this will change over time though.
