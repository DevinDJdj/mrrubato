Looking at the openai/jukebox code a bit.  
For now just trying to get it to work.  
SO annoying.

Well, I need an NVIDIA card for this, really annoying.  
Why would they do that, I guess this is just for testing anyway probably.  


Eventually should show some of this work being done on the computer, even the setup portions, but for now it is too annoying to do.  
Not sure if I will feel like doing this in the future.  

Not sure if listening at 2x speed is a good idea, but going to test it for a while.  
Especially since I want to save time for developing.
