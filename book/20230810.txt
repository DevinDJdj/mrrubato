Adding this for face camera.  
I think that is better.  

Should use color to represent age of comments.  
Fade color with age.  
Should keep dates with all comments.  
Then have options regarding how to display when those comments were made.  
This is really meant for commenting once, but could have very different applications
as a communication tool.  


**fingertest.py
Break down hit or miss by Iteration.  
If first iteration is far better, then we know we have a problem with timing.  
Check if it is a timing issue, paint the midi notes on the images we display.  
Then we will see if there is some problem or not.  

Midi is definitely faster than the frames.  
I think I need to ignore some frames perhaps?  
Or the starttime calculation needs to change.  

Print out the midi time and the frame time.  
Cant see where this is coming from, matching the time.  

Maybe build in the lag as a multiple of how much has been played.  
Not sure why but it seems slightly lagged.  
Did we change record to get the original message time?
