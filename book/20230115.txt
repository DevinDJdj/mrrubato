--Analyze.html 
mostly done at least for my initial purposes.  
Kind of tired of listening to my playing though, so I havent done any for several days.  
I have been adjusting the physical Piano desk to allow me to code more easily at the piano.  
With this page now I should be able to take notes though without needing to type which is a big time saver within the process.  
Next I would like to add the midi analysis to this.  
Also should automatically run statistics on previous iterations of the same song.  Do a Search for the same songs and retrieve the midi from 
those notes.  
For now just do some basic statistical analysis regarding speed and notes per second etc.  
And then analyze the words which are used.  
We should limit our usage to well known phrases like "like this" etc.  
Dont want to automatically update the description for now even though that is more convenient since this site and code is all completely open.  
Should probably take a backup of all the descriptions from time to time just in case there is someone who is wicked and attempts to ruin the data that is there somehow.  
It is always possible in the attempt to make everything open, I have allowed the website to be compromised by some bad actor.  

--Play.py
Initial sample coding done here.  
Next steps should be to add the pitch wheel functionality so that I can make precise mathematical calculations when generating the midi.  
Not sure if I want to keep using the CSound functionality or just move everything to midi.  
Need adjustment of pitch wheel and adjustment of instrument functions before I can do much.
