I had mostly forgotten that I started to write from time to time.  
Too much of my thought is occupied by the ins and outs of actually creating something.  
I wonder how much music plays a part in this.  As I have done other large projects before, but never publicized anything.  
Maybe music is just what made me want to share it more than anything.  

What makes us desire to share with another being.  
This is a very personal and complex question.  
But I guess this is the equivalent of my "I WAS HERE" grafitti.. (pronunciation-enhansed speling)

I am enjoying making it, although I do have second thoughts from time to time about sharing.  
If I dont share though, the possibilities are limited in a fundamental way, and music helped me see that if nothing else.  

How do we create an organization?  
The answer to this is fundamental to the organization that results.  

Knowing this helps in the choosing.  

I must say, I cannot see why more people have not chosen to annotate thought during creation.  
Some people start to do this in a more meaningful way.  

But the combination of this along with computer power is going to make things possible that...
yeah..

Anyway, all the details of making software are still quite taxing.  
Even if they are being made easier with "superautocomplete"

At 28-29, I started my largest project which helped me understand data about the Planet (published, never used much, never advertised).  
This project no longer functions because of changes to the technology it was built on, but could probably be re-started.

This is not available online, only the source code which is probably similar size to 5x this project at this time.
