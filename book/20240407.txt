**server/...

Do we want to set up as services?  
https://medium.com/codex/setup-a-python-script-as-a-service-through-systemctl-systemd-f0cc55a42267

I think probably need this.  
Or is there another pattern which makes this easy? 

**web/public/analyze.html
adjust to useyoutube when video ID was not found in DB.  
for now just use 
watch parameter.  
useyoutube || watch

Need to add some usage statistics to users/uid...



**timestep.py
pass file download info to 
**server/transcription/transcribe.py
for non-youtube use.  
If we can get from youtube, do so, otherwise use the media info passed.  
Just pass every time.  

**server/transcription/server.py
OK, start times and end times being passed, now have to generate the wav files.  
Only do this with public videos also have to correct the text prior.  
Need to copy coqui to server and test.  
Rabbit hole continues...
OK, lets try to see if we can load coqui in base directory and actually get this generating data.  
So somewhere around 10GB perhaps, then we should delete this all or download/delete after done.  


**web/public/analyze.html
Need ability to fix the transcription ideally.  
but dont think I want to deal with that now, due to the way the process works.  
Not sure how important this is.  


**web/public/analyze.html
**web/public/**
Add time that user was added.  
Code added - See if this worked.  


**server/
Need to make servers more robust.  
Unexpected queries shouldnt cause problems.  

sudo systemctl start transcription.service
sudo systemctl start tts.service
