**server/...

Do we want to set up as services?  
https://medium.com/codex/setup-a-python-script-as-a-service-through-systemctl-systemd-f0cc55a42267

I think probably need this.  
Or is there another pattern which makes this easy? 

**web/public/analyze.html
adjust to useyoutube when video ID was not found in DB.  
for now just use 
watch parameter.  
useyoutube || watch

Need to add some usage statistics to users/uid...



**timestep.py
pass file download info to 
**server/transcription/transcribe.py
for non-youtube use.  
If we can get from youtube, do so, otherwise use the media info passed.  
Just pass every time.  

**server/transcription/server.py
OK, start times and end times being passed, now have to generate the wav files.  
Only do this with public videos also have to correct the text prior.  

**web/public/analyze.html
Need ability to fix the transcription ideally.  
but dont think I want to deal with that now, due to the way the process works.  
Not sure how important this is.  


**web/public/analyze.html
**web/public/**
Add time that user was added.  
Code added - See if this worked.
