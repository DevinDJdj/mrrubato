This exploration has led me in a variety of directions.  
I have had a bit of a realization regarding why so many people find the interaction with computers taxing.  
I think.  
@@Is it the constant context switching for input mechanism?  
~~We really should have a fairly constant input mechanism for communication.  
Input mechanism in this sense being the way in which we input data for sending.  

We all struggle in our own unique ways to adapt to this fundamental flaw in the communication design which has existed
since the dawn of the computer age.  

We are on the verge of a variety of things at the moment with computers.  But I believe the communication design will undergo
a major revolution soon.  

Computer Shell interaction should have included this type of ongoing discussion at a much more fundamental level than code comments.
