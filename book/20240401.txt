ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement piper-phonemize~=1.1.0 (from piper-tts) (from versions: none)

Do we want to go through the trouble of building this.  
OK, look for other solutions?  
What other packages exist.  


OK, lets try this one.
try coqui TTS
wsl --distribution VENV
https://www.linuxcapable.com/install-python-3-8-on-ubuntu-linux/
pip install pip setuptools wheel tts
tts-server --list_models
tts-server --model_name tts_models/en/jenny/jenny  
http://localhost:5002/

That worked to start.  


python3 -m venv .
source ./bin/activate
pip3 install pip setuptools wheel --upgrade
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS

git clone https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS
/test/tts/coqui/TTS

python3 ./setup.py install

Tacotron2 based model training?  

Check input DATA:
--HERE--
test/tts/coqui/TTS/TTS/bin/compute_statistics.py --config_path (config.json) --out_path (stats_path) 

config.json (where is this?)
stats_path -> "output.npy"
test_sentences_file -> "sentences.txt"
Just anything in this.  
datasets -> LJSpeech directory.  



**server/tts/train.py --initeration "false"
In here download all needed (to start just a few files)
along with the transcript files.  
Utilize all the transcript files.  
If the transcript time is outside iteration, take the sample.  


initeration or not.  Need to detect voice probably or do we?  



**server/tts/server.py
Call the TTS/bin/synthesize.py
and return the wav or best format file.  
call locally from **server/ollama/server.py or just call after we get response in the browser.  
Response speed will improve gradually.  

We can update these transcript files from **web/public/analyze.html
**server/transcription/server.py
->api->update

**web/public/server/tts.html
->tts/server.py->api->train.py

becoming spaghetti?  


TRAIN here:
test/tts/coqui/TTS/TTS/tts

test/tts/coqui/TTS/TTS/bin/train_tacotron.py


Synthesize here:
test/tts/coqui/TTS/TTS/bin/synthesize.py


I dont think we need to make this iterative.  
It is fine to do this once every year or so.
