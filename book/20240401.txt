ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement piper-phonemize~=1.1.0 (from piper-tts) (from versions: none)

Do we want to go through the trouble of building this.  
OK, look for other solutions?  
What other packages exist.  


OK, lets try this one.
try coqui TTS
wsl --distribution VENV
https://www.linuxcapable.com/install-python-3-8-on-ubuntu-linux/
pip install pip setuptools wheel tts
tts-server --list_models
tts-server --model_name tts_models/en/jenny/jenny  
http://localhost:5002/

That worked to start.
