ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement piper-phonemize~=1.1.0 (from piper-tts) (from versions: none)

Do we want to go through the trouble of building this.  
OK, look for other solutions?  
What other packages exist.  


OK, lets try this one.
try coqui TTS
wsl --distribution VENV
https://www.linuxcapable.com/install-python-3-8-on-ubuntu-linux/
pip install pip setuptools wheel tts
tts-server --list_models
tts-server --model_name tts_models/en/jenny/jenny  
http://localhost:5002/

That worked to start.  


python3 -m venv .
source ./bin/activate
pip3 install pip setuptools wheel --upgrade
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS

git clone https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS
/test/tts/coqui/TTS

python3 ./setup.py install

Tacotron2 based model training?  

Check input DATA:
--HERE--
test/tts/coqui/TTS/TTS/bin/compute_statistics.py --config_path (config.json) --out_path (stats_path) 

config.json (where is this?)
stats_path -> "output.npy"
test_sentences_file -> "sentences.txt"
Just anything in this.  
datasets -> LJSpeech directory.  


TRAIN here:
test/tts/coqui/TTS/TTS/tts

test/tts/coqui/TTS/TTS/bin/train_tacotron.py

Synthesize here:

I dont think we need to make this iterative.  
It is fine to do this once every year or so.
