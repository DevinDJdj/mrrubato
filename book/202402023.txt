**languages/base
create struct.  

**extensions/handsfree/sidepanel.js
inject generated QR code based on the URL.  
Needs to be visible in the case that we utilize the recording or activate when recording active.  
Probably we can get from tabs, but do we need to display?  I think it is better this way.  
This QR code should be visible on each page.  
Or maybe this functionality if we can keep it visible.  
https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/ui/add-popup

OK, this might work.  

Want to trigger this QR load onactivate though perhaps?  
OK, this works ok.  
Need to have function to hide these elements.  
Maybe only make visible if recording.  
Do we want to divide between URL and path?  
We can do that on backend.  
Need URL -> Video(time)
and 

also use built-in bookmarks 
chrome.bookmarks.getTree(function (
    bookmarkTreeNodes
  ) {
    $('#bookmarks').append(dumpTreeNodes(bookmarkTreeNodes, query));
  });

  Just add to the injection function.

**timestep.py
something timing out here for a certain video.  
Need to check why.  


**web/public/chat.html
Need to organize the responses better still.  
We should have a table which grows in a more orderly fashion.  
Latest comments should be at the top for ease of use.  
This is better with a table, but what do we put on the right of this screen?  
Load the full transcript on the right of whatever video is playing.  
--loadMidiFeedback
Check errors in loadMidiFeedback function


**server/transcription/server.py
Change this to use the Blob instead of downloading.  

**web/public/analyze.html
Change to load the mediafile if exists.  
Then slowly change to use this component.
