create struct.  

**extensions/handsfree/sidepanel.js
inject generated QR code based on the URL.  
Needs to be visible in the case that we utilize the recording or activate when recording active.  
Probably we can get from tabs, but do we need to display?  I think it is better this way.  
This QR code should be visible on each page.  
Or maybe this functionality if we can keep it visible.  
https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/ui/add-popup

OK, this might work.  

Want to trigger this QR load onactivate though perhaps?  


also use built-in bookmarks 
chrome.bookmarks.getTree(function (
    bookmarkTreeNodes
  ) {
    $('#bookmarks').append(dumpTreeNodes(bookmarkTreeNodes, query));
  });

  Just add to the injection function.
