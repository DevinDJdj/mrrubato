--recent.html
Need an recent.html page which shows the analyze.html link for the previous several recorded.  

--analyze.html
need to add a javascript midi library which loads the midi from the recording and shows some statistics comparing with previous iterations.  
Options:
https://jazz-soft.net/demo/ReadMidiFile.html
http://minitorn.tlu.ee/~jaagup/kool/java/kursused/14/gm/MIDI.js-master/demo-MIDIPlayer.html
https://galactic.ink/piano/

For now just take this and adjust it to fit the page for me.  
Not sure I want this in the analyze page, just make a new page

--midi.html perhaps.  
Dont really like this name.  
Just use the videoID and pull the midi link from this.  



--analyze.html 
should have the midi loaded and just some analytics on that midi.  
For now do the midi.html first until we are more familiar with the functionality.

--midi2.html
galactic.ink/piano/
 actually better, but they have minified the code.  
OK, unminified, and this is much better quality.  
Lets just adjust this to load from our midi.  
Put the midi play link into the recent.  
Maybe make something like midilyze for now so we dont have anything too complex.  

--midilyze.html
Load previous X midi files from the same song and use the midi tools to analyze them or look at them side-by-side.  


*note*
sometimes the firebase takes a while to upload.  
Wait 5 mins if something is not there.  

Give props somehow in midi2.html 

--midi2.html
Next step, load a midi file which I have generated from videoID.  
Line 3674 - MidiFile
3867 pushing the notes just to an array.  
Dont really care about the internals of midi at the moment.  
Maybe easier to look in the browser debugger at i.e. Replayer 3884 for example to see what exactly we have here.  
The coding here is not the easiest to read.  
Especially all the simplified function names.  
Doesnt really look obfuscated, but it may have been run through a simple obfuscator which only obfuscated some of the function names.  
So deconstructing this is going to be annoying, but it works well, so lets use this.  

Tried to match them up.  The midi has some lag, so this may be hard to match up actually with the audio.  
We would have to fast-forward the midi every 10 seconds or so slightly, or pause the video.  
When listening, just have the animation perhaps and try to match up every so often.
