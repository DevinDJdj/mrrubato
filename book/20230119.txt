--recent.html
Need an recent.html page which shows the analyze.html link for the previous several recorded.  

--analyze.html
need to add a javascript midi library which loads the midi from the recording and shows some statistics comparing with previous iterations.  
Options:
https://jazz-soft.net/demo/ReadMidiFile.html
http://minitorn.tlu.ee/~jaagup/kool/java/kursused/14/gm/MIDI.js-master/demo-MIDIPlayer.html
https://galactic.ink/piano/

For now just take this and adjust it to fit the page for me.  
Not sure I want this in the analyze page, just make a new page

--midi.html perhaps.  
Dont really like this name.  
Just use the videoID and pull the midi link from this.  



--analyze.html 
should have the midi loaded and just some analytics on that midi.  
For now do the midi.html first until we are more familiar with the functionality.  


--midi2.html
galactic.ink/piano/
 actually better, but they have minified the code.  
OK, unminified, and this is much better quality.  
Lets just adjust this to load from our midi.  
Put the midi play link into the recent.  
Maybe make something like midilyze for now so we dont have anything too complex.
