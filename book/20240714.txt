"change color for " word (color, 12-12)


**server
Try Deepspeech insead of Coqui for STT/TTS training.  
There is some poor compatibility with the NVIDIA driver that Coqui causes.  
Functionality is the same.  

**server/transcription/server.py
Need update of STT to use Deepspeech or similar.  
I guess try this:

**web/public/analyze.html
Test:
MscGMds1wn4

OK, multiple users ok now, but how do we distinguish between them in the feedbackImage?  

Build meta commands, playback filtered list.  
Playback with filter functionality.  
Need to create/test this.  

This should also run the commands associated with the transcript.  Whatever they are, or have the option to.  
If we are running the commands, we should add to our feedback channel of whatever the language is for our user?  
Or should that be separate option?

Should test
set octave 

Go ahead and complete seekTo Functionality.  

Need to fix the login functionality.  


**web/public/db.js
Need to move some things here as well.  




**web/public/analyze.html
How do we draw on the frame of the video?  
Annotation on the video should be a basic function.  
Need to drive from MIDI first

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Manipulating_video_using_canvas
draw transcript just above keys?  
Not sure if it will work well with youtube.  

test highlightvideo function.  

How/what do we want to display?  
Embed video on BabylonJS
https://playground.babylonjs.com/#1DX9UE#3

Make video hidden and draw canvas in the same location as the video.  

Make video hidden, and then 


OK, lets keep this along with the video for now.  
Draw on this copy any text and info needed.  
Could also match up the midi keyboard notes.  
Maybe match up the BabylonJS underneath.  
And push the static info to the right.  
Yeah I think that's better organization.  
Make video a bit larger and Stack previous and graphic in the first td


Lets only display the words in the list which we have times for.  
Others we can hide.  
So on setTimes, we should display the row.  
$(row).hide();

Just do with filter.  
Not sure if this is what we want.  
                    dictable.columns(DIC_TIMES).search((d) => d !== "").draw();


Add function to add transcript (comments) in a general fashion.  
Need EOW with this.  
Need different EOW I guess?  
0,0,0 clears.  24,24,24 accepts.  
24,24,24?  Allow empty midi, and just pull spoken text.  

Shifted language-specific command sets should mimic meta set if possible.  

Accept use of keyboard if there is no midi.  
Turn on/off keyboard function.  
Or accept topline numbers (~-+ = 0-12, SHIFT = 12-24)
