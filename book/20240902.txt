**server
Try Deepspeech insead of Coqui for STT/TTS training.  
There is some poor compatibility with the NVIDIA driver that Coqui causes.  
Functionality is the same.  

**server/transcription/server.py
Need update of STT to use Deepspeech or similar.  
I guess try this:

wav_filename,wav_filesize,transcript
train.csv, dev.csv, and test.csv

What data do we have up to this point?  
Download all data.  
myhome + "/TTS/recipes/ljspeech/LJSpeech-1.1/metadata.csv"

Reformat, and then ingest.

Try to just use this first.

See if we can get any TTS first, then go to the Deepspeech model to ingest the data better.  
Fix text in metadata.csv if we want.  


Can we make a pipeline to add incoming to voice recognition STT, and then also to TTS engine.  
Have two custom engines.  
STT needs context probably.  At least pace of speech etc.  

Anyway for now just try to get both into pipeline and generate custom models.  

python3 ./TTS/bin/compute_statistics.py --config_path /mnt/c/devinpiano/music/server/tts/mozilla/config.json --out_path /mnt/c/devinpiano/music/server/tts/scale_stats.npy

-->Here
python3 ./TTS/bin/train_tacotron.py --config_path /mnt/c/devinpiano/music/server/tts/mozilla/config.json
