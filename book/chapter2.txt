LOL, just started reading the Chopin biography, and still in the prologue, but I had to laugh at a few of the things.  
I am not comparing myself to Chopin, just trying to understand why I like his music.  
But I have decided to learn a bit more about the people who made the music.  
Because I do believe understanding a person's life and thoughts are of vital importance to try to understand the work.  



1. Tuberculosis is no laughing matter.  
I guess I shouldnt complain about my minor struggle with insomnia.  


2. Chopin didnt like Liszt, as I suspected.  I only made this assumption based on the part of one of Chopin's pieces which has "a Liszt" in it.  
I have seen other markings like this, but this particular part was just an abrasive few minutes inside of a nice melodic piece.  
And it just seems out of place.  I think he was teasing him.  
I am curious now about the other dedications and who the people were.  
The music definitely has meaning of sorts, but how to interpret that meaning is something I look forward to contemplating.  
I will try not to let the fact that I am reading about him hinder my interpretation, but the words of the books I read may seep into my subconcious mind.  



3. Chopin liked playing in front of "friends", and not necessarily for the public.  Luckily now we can make the performances available with the technology we have.  
I still havent decided how to approach what to do (record or not, publish or not) when I play while other people are around.  
Since I record video and often the surrounding sounds along with the piano, it is a conundrum.  
Playing occurs in my home, but I want to respect peoples' privacy.  
Having a discussion about whether I can publish the music I play with each individual in the vicinity is an annoyance and a time suck I could do without.  
Perhaps I will mark these and publish them at a much later date when nobody really cares anymore.  
At the moment people are unsure exactly what to feel when they find out what I am doing.  
I recall mentioning to someone that I upload everything to youtube, and she was interested in how many followers I have.  
I said 30 and she laughed.  The social media aspect of today's world has warped our understanding of what is important in the world.  
I dont really participate, although I have tried to a bit more recently.  
The primary purpose of the "WORK" is not to have people follow me.  However I do want to make the "WORK" public.  


4. Chopin would often during the course of creation end up back where he started after much toil.  
This makes me think of how easy it is to record and analyze all of the creations now with the help of computers.  
I intend to utilize technology as much as I find convenient to provide the best process during creation as well as analysis.  
If I am able to contribute anything substantial to the musical world from the "WORK", my integration of technology into the creative process is probably what it will be.  
But I may become fairly good at piano in the meantime.  I am very interested in the learning curve and intend to analyze it when I have enough good data.  

5. Chopin was influenced by Beethoven, Mozart and Bach.  
This reminded me that I havent recorded much/anything from Mozart/Bach yet, but I do like both.  

6. Chopin's preference for "p (piano)" is something I think I share.  I often write "like that light touch" or something similar when reviewing my playing.  
I recall recently when my wife's friend, who is a very good pianist, came over and played something.  
I had to turn down the volume on her (sorry).  



Thinking about the technology aspect of things, I am trying to organize how exactly I should utilize keywords with each upload.  
In order to analyze the data afterwards, I think I need markings for 
MOOD and perhaps some other things.  


I decided this time for this musical "WORK", I would start sharing from a very early stage.  
For what is palatable to most people, it is probably too early.  
However as mentioned in chapter1, I have done extremely large (and quite interesting) projects by myself, and never published them.  
But I couldnt forgive myself if I did that with something as sharing and communicative as music.  
So I started sharing from a very early stage.  I am glad I did, because it has now become part of the process to share this source code, and the words.  


Note to self:
No need to mark WORDS in the description.  
We can just use the other markings to extract the audio from the segments which are not between START/END, and try to use a speech to text engine at some point to get the words.
