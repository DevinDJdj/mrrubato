Need to add last word to status.  
Along with add status to history listing.  

along with 
From stats generate some icon.  
Just timewithoutplaying/timewithplaying
along with mouseover for transcript.  
on mouseover show the image and the transcript.  
Just use the components we have.  
Have a hidden transcript box, and just show on mouse-over, mouse-out.  
Should feel like zooming in and out of time.  
create a load function so we could just hover and click without reloading the full page.  
This is a good idea anyway.  
fullReload, I think I started.  
loadAll()
Add possibility to reload user, and just video.  
So just set the videoID, and then call loadAll...
So have partial load without video and full load also replacing video.  
See if this will work first of all.  

Maybe dynamic search/listing area in top left.  
How do we design this?  
Generic search across DB, Title Search, Author search.  
Author -> userID lookup.  
Allow resizing of components.  
Top left:
------Search---- (future)
video (current)
-----Word History---- (past)
dont overwrite this on loadAll.  
Continue this past on 4th column top?  

Second column
Video Details (current)
Video history (past)
----future word (future)

Third column
----Current state --- (current)
future command (future)
---current video feedback (current/past)

Fourth column
Transcript (current)
future command (future) --Maybe move this to the 3rd column?  
---current video feedback (current/past)

Maybe switch original transcript and key lookup.  
Put all keylookup on 4th column.  

Then it would be 

FCC(C/F)
CPFF
P(C/F)CC

Or maybe 4th column top can be continuation of previously played items?  
along with the current lookups we have now.  
yeah I like that.  
Just the 25 key.  with maybe 3 listings.  
And on the bottom left we have the full 88-key just two or three listings.  


Can we overlay the graphics on the UI components?  
ok somewhat nicer.  
Orig transcript and My transcript should progress at the same time.  
Show the currently played iteration across this area.  
Same UI component, just smaller viewport.  

Go back to making words.  
Need to be able to move forward with this.  
Before that need language construction basic grammar.  
...
If we try simple transition, we will end up with an isomorph of a known language perhaps.  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban#Grammar
Make numerically significant.  

For now part of speech determiner is beginning of word.  
AB = single step is noun for now.  

All reference is postpositional with regards to order of speech.  
N M (by default if there is a reference for this part of speech it refers to the )
N<-M

Why do we have pre-positional and post-positional arguments in most human languages?  
SVO and SOV are primary word orders, so just use this I guess.  

Word classes distinguishable enough.  
Subject - AC
Verb - AD
Object - AE

For now work on noun definition.  

AC->word content
word content:
CD, CE, CF, CG, etc.. 
each define a class of deterministic words?  
the combination of these deterministic words defines the noun.  
Order of use is also significant.  
can use one or multiple.  
Can we make ring type relationship?  
Perhaps we can use a polar coord?  
CB = 30
CC = 0
CDb = -30
Simple motion graphic?  
what correlates with octave?  
Speed correlates to strike?  
Try out mouse movement with this.  
Slows as sound fades.  
Right is clockwise

**analyze/analyze.py
-printMidiGif()
play with this idea perhaps generate a new graphic from the midi besides piano roll.  
Lets generate this in the browser?  
Once we reach a certain radius, we reflect back into the circle.  
Or could use essentially a gravity effect.  
Use line color for octave in this, play a bit.  
Make a record with lines within the record.  
This way we get a sense of start/end.  
Can we generate an animated gif which includes this type of radial outward spiral and volume indicator.  
Spiral inward, rotate the disc around one time for the song itself?  
Color indicates timbre, size indicates volume.  
Generate animated gif.  
Quantization - .1 seconds I guess.  and .05 seconds?  
or .05 and .025
images[0].save('data/dst/pillow_imagedraw.gif',
               save_all=True, append_images=images[1:], optimize=False, duration=40, loop=0)
test this.  
create realtime and half time gif.  
How big is this for piano roll, is it interesting?  
Is animated gif the right solution?  
var image = new Image();
image.src = "path";
when you want to use:

nextimg_img.attr('src', image.src);
Create for each iteration, and start when that iteration starts.  

Add time for each note and test.  
Also experiment with 24 key circle instead of 12.  
Maybe this is more interesting.  

**web/public/testdoodle.html
realtime interaction to draw on canvas or BabylonJS based on midi input.  
For now 2 note vectors.  Add force vectors essentially.  
Use circular mapping for now.  
i.e. C0C1 -> increase speed.  
C1D1 lifts 
C1B1 decline
Leave trail and constantly adjust color to track.  
Octave is speed
Anything else is rotational.  
how to treat different octaves?  
upper octaves are simply for refinement?  
Make this with the language construct?  
keymap functions.  
Need better reaction time though. 
Need direct function call once word is recognized.  
Need to recall this area.  

Really should start using this import mechanism

**timestep.py
Should update stats/wordsrecognized after doing transcript.  
--done


**book.html
Maybe a visualization of the book portion of this may be interesting.  
Add visualization of the book part of the code here?  

**server/ollama
Eventually
Ingesting this the same way we ingest the transcriptions.  


**web/public/analyze.html
have a bug if pianoroll not loading.  
I think this is the iteration calc.  
No spotlight.  
--maybe fixed.  

Several things, may have introduced bugs.  


**languages
Parts of speech
Control structure via this type of syntax.  
Not sure how to do this, need more brainstorming.  
XXX - no repetition, no larger jump than AE, and no AEXXXEA can be contained.  
Simple pattern with octaves can still be done.  

A can represent any key, start on whichever preferred.  

Noun - ABXXXBA
Most nouns will be ABD...DBA


Pronoun - Specific case
prefix ABC can be like memory registers.  
We can use whatever octaves.  
What other constraints do we need?  
ABCDA
ABCEA
ABCGA etc.  


Adjective
BAXXXAB
general structure will be 
BAG mentioning the one just previous.  




Preposition
DAXXXAD


Verb
ACXXXCA


Adverb
CAxxxAC

Conjunction
AEXXXEA

New sentence/Separator
EAXXXAE

Maybe try this.  
So syntax/modification is controlled by this structure.  

Do we want any other parts of speech?  

If unidirectional, no need for Closure bracket.  
Perhaps have closure bracket optional.  

So this is a basic structure, does it actually work.  

Numbers:
Use chromatic scale here?  
AB' = 1
AB = 2
AC = 3 ..

Syntax is most important.  
This is not wonderful to represent audially.  

Operators
Functions

Similar to programmatic structure.  

Todo:
Study linguistics for programming languages.  
maybe investigate LISP a bit more.  
And learn carbon probably useful at some point.  

Can we use this?  
https://github.com/LIPS-scheme/lips?tab=readme-ov-file
Is this a good scheme for us?  

https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang


**web/public/analyze.html
Need to put the minimap up top perhaps?  
Or a copy of one.  
How do we merge/should we merge feedback?  

use ROLI dynamic messages?  
This limits user adoption.  

Stop just postulating, just write a few simple mappings.  

The language itself can be the pre-post fix in certain cases.  
Bracketed word
LLL WORD LLL

Instead of using META CHANGE lang
