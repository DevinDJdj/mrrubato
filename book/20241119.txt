add language doodle (-9,-3)

--start here..
0 reference better?  
Negative just for notation?  
Use notation shift or store negative?  
I think middle 0 reference is going to be better.

change language (-9,-3)
add word line (-9,-6)
add word box (-4,-2)
add word set coordinates (2,4) [5,7 7,9]
add word polar (5,7)
add word grid (7,9)

Need function to continue deciphering words even after we have a prefix.  
This should be default.  

How can we make this function adding completely dynamic?  

For now see if we can use this language after adding words.  

Need to create a map from func -> 

Think we need a MyChat function for each language.  
This way we pass along whatever language is actually executed.  
Pass language to Chat(..., lang)
Then go to the 

**web/public/languages/doodle.js
test doodle chat line.  
                console.log("doodle chat line " + midi);

remember previous x, y.  
add keymap[xxx].vars dict.  
add keymap[xxx].settings dict.  
add keymap[xxx].load function.  
This should be saved and loaded in loadLanguage.  
load local settings if necessary.  

Keep any state info in vars dict.  

**web/public/analyze.html
Problem in getFeedbackImage.  
When updating midiarray in the middle.  
We have a problem with shifting index numbers.  

See if we can use generated font here.  
Each user should have a character representation.  
So this will go along with the word to indicate speaker.  


**web/public/config.js
Added some user config.

Study Mirad Language.  
Has some of the aspects I like.

Good reference if not more.  
This may be a good test case.  
Can basically map one key to each consonant.  
<!--
The letters c and q are used only to represent words and names imported into Mirad from other languages
-->
So skip these.  
Then we have a simple mapping.  
How to distinguish without perfect pitch.  
We have relative.  
Need multiple octaves for testing this sort of thing.  

Several of the grammar concepts are nice.

This seems one of the most advanced conlangs of interest.

Check writing system here.  
<!--
the writing system is morpho-phonetic, meaning two types of graphemes are used: one to represent different grammatical concepts, such as case, number etc. and the other to represent roots and affixes.

a priori languages are of most interest.  

Perhaps to start only augment existing spoken language with punctuation and other markings.
