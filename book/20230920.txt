Need to do more programming.  

Need UI to go through the notes for each item.  
**xxxx
take all these comments by file, and then we need to have some sort of way to indicate completion.  
Match up the comment with completion or at least progress. 

Lots of comments that just get forgotten. 
automate the addition to latest book.txt
When we complete something mark as - done in the original and also in the new book.txt
Must be some github tool to do this easier.  


**analyze.py
First find matches across iterations. 
What sequence of notes can we find that is the same.  
Then we can expand this.  

Map -> start note -> relative N-Gram -> iteration / time in piece.  

Create this structure.  
Then we can do something with it.  
Add to this function
->getNgrams()

Can have relative and non-relative
Map -> relative N-Gram -> iteration / time in piece

make the calculation for single harmonic word.  
Already have a place for this ngramsp

we should really have mathematical relationship between 
actual frequency and ngramsp.  
But right now hard to figure out how to do this.  

So for now mathematical relationship between ngramsp word and midi representation is ok.  

**sidebar
Word - This reminds me of old windows programming, and when things first were starting we represented function parameters as "words".  


I think we need future relationship as well.  
So not just prevmsg, but future msg as well.  
Create this array.  


Need to test this later.  
printNgrams
