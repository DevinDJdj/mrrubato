**web/public/keymap.js
Should we use 21, 22 in the web UI?  
Could use to load (pull for any updates)/update (save my updates).  
Probably lets use a different set of commands.  
21,21,21 perhaps.  22,22,22

Can we combine words from different languages ok with the current structure.  
This is important, we will have some dictionaries of just identifiers.  
And we want to be able to create abstract terms which refer to those identifiers.  
So i.e. 
add language company directory
add word yyyy@zzz.com (identifier)

Then afterward
****COMPANYDIRECTORY****xxxMYLANGxxx
use multiple dics and combine words/parameters
MYLANGFUNC -> Directory entry.  


Ah something maybe useful which I can use without too much trouble.

So in this case player can be a prefix or a postfix.  
Structure should contain an element of distance.
