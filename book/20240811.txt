**web/public/recent.html
Need recent watch as well as created.  
Add watch parameter
watch=true

sort by: 
/watch/[videoid]/snippet/addedAt

add value:
/watch/[videoid]/comments/[uid]/pctWatched

Use these two parameters to sort results.  

How do we add videos to watch?  



**web/public/languages.js
"change color for " word (color, 12-12)


**server
Try Deepspeech insead of Coqui for STT/TTS training.  
There is some poor compatibility with the NVIDIA driver that Coqui causes.  
Functionality is the same.  

**server/transcription/server.py
Need update of STT to use Deepspeech or similar.  
I guess try this:

**web/public/db.js
Need to move some things here as well.  



**web/public/keymap.js
Should we use 21, 22 in the web UI?  
Could use to load (pull for any updates)/update (save my updates).  
Probably lets use a different set of commands.  
21,21,21 perhaps.  22,22,22

Can we combine words from different languages ok with the current structure.  
This is important, we will have some dictionaries of just identifiers.  
And we want to be able to create abstract terms which refer to those identifiers.  
So i.e. 
add language company directory
add word yyyy@zzz.com (identifier)
Need location to input this text.  
Then we refer using this directory.  


Then afterward
****COMPANYDIRECTORY****xxxMYLANGxxx
use multiple dics and combine words/parameters
MYLANGFUNC -> Directory entry.  


Ah something maybe useful which I can use without too much trouble.

**web/public/midi.js
onEnabled()->
Accept use of keyboard if there is no midi.  

Turn on/off keyboard function.  
Or accept topline numbers (~-+ = 0-12, SHIFT = 12-24)

Test this

add language tennis (-6,6)
--start here.  
Hmmmm... not working great.  
Also feedback is multiplied by the number of languages.  
Why is this occurring.  

analyze.html?video=mj4jpeBvD2o
change language (-6,6)
add word hit (6,6)
how do we have synonyms?  This would get overwritten
Could have something mimicing back and forth across net.  
add word backhand (6,1) 
add word forehand (6,3) 
add word slice (6,2)
add word topspin (6,4)
add word volley (6,8)
add word drop (6,10)
add word serve (10,11)

add word fault (10,9)
add word let (10,8)
add word out (5,5)
add word long (5,6)
add word net (5,4)
add word bounce (4,4)
add word applause (3,4)
add word noise (3,5)

add word score (2,2) (param = 3,4,5,6,7)
2,8 = minus point, 2,3 = plus point, 2,4 plus game, 2,5 plus set
2,9 = minus game, 2,10 minus set 



add word player one (9,8)
add word player two (9,10)
9,8 = set player 1
9,10 = set player 2

2,3,9,8 = player 1 gets point

In general should structure from left to right.  
So in this case player can be a prefix or a postfix.  
Structure should contain an element of distance.  



**web/public/analyze.html
Can we use a pressed SHIFT/CTRL to extend the command input?  
Cant capture this off-screen.  So wont work.  Could use midi keys for this I guess.  
As long as this is in pressed state, dont remove input queue.  
Need some adjustment to the command building.  
How do we get better timing from the voice input?  
checkCommands...


---------Use pedal??----------
once pedal is released read the command.  This may be a good option.  
Lets try two methodologies.  
With pedal and as we started.  
Maybe annoying to need to do the pedal.  
Perhaps when pedal is down, dont checkCommands until released.  
This way we just use the same function and just react differently based on pedal.  
Also commands arent very harmonic at the moment.  
Maybe make more musical even if we have to make longer commands.  

Seaboard Block M messages not detected by webmidi.  
**web/public/midi.js
What messages are we getting?  
			input.channels[1].addListener("midimessage", (event) => {console.log(event); getMIDIMessage(event.data); });

This is not receiving any, but device seems connected.  
I like the device, but only 24 keys instead of 25.  This will be a problem.  


**analyze/analyze.py
Lets go ahead and make some more stats about note frequency etc.  
/misterrubato/[id]/stats
timeplaying
numnotes

Consistency between iterations
#unique words
#word duration
#stddev of duration
Analyze a few different word lengths in this way.  
Use relative distance from initial key, not absolute
This will find some generated patterns.  
Try to distinguish generated patterns from read patterns.  
General Tempo analysis.  

**extension
From extension can we open the site and work side-by-side?  



**web/public/analyze.html

Need a flag to accept incoming text


Some spaghetti around the pedal logic.  
Lets see if this improves the functionality though.  


**web/public/analyze.html
Still need to show the feedback immediately.  


**doc2vec
BLAS library for optimized bulk vector operations
Dont worry for now, it is 50x slower on non-optimized.

When pedal down, just use filter and nothing else.  
Should be working like this.  
Need to use this more. 
Just use voice commands.  
When voice commands are used, we should filter and see key commands.  
Gradually may/should use this.  

Maybe show midiRecent in the status
