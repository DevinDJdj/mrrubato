#use these libraries to create a graph of relationship between sequence iterations.  
#Node for each NGRAM.  
#Only analyze sets which have meaning across a certain timespan.  
#what timespan is meaningful?  
#time segmentation only may be somewhat interesting.  
#Lets say timespan of between 2 and 20 seconds to start.  
#what are the graph bonds between two iterations and same iteration etc.  
#between other pieces
